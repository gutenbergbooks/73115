<p>
This story is intended for three classes of readers,
and no more.  It is intended for those who have to
bring up children, for those who have to bring up
themselves, and for those who, in order that they
may think of bettering the weaker, are, on their own
part, strong enough to begin that task by bearing
a knowledge of the truth.
</p>

<p>
For it is the truth only that I have told.  Throughout
this narrative there is no incident that is not a
daily commonplace in the life of the underworld of
every large city.  If proof were needed, the
newspapers have, during the last twelvemonth, proved
as much.  I have written only what I have myself
seen and myself heard, and I set it down for none
but those who may profit by it.

<h3>
I
<br><br>
"AS IF THE SPRING WERE ALL YOUR OWN"
</h3>

<p>
The local weather-prophets&mdash;the cape-coated
Mennonites and the bearded Amishmen, who
came into the town to market&mdash;had said, with
choral unanimity, that the spring would be brief
and sudden, and the summer parching and intense.
</p>

<p>
Already, though April had but dawned, the pink
arbutus had bloomed and withered, and the pale first
violets were peeping, purple and fragrant, among
the lush grass of the front yards on Second Street.
The annual oriole was a full fortnight ahead of his
time in opening his summer-house in the hickory-tree
on the Southwarks' lawn; and up in the droning
study-room of the high-school, where all the windows
were wide to the lazy sunlight, Miss England had
begun, this week, to direct the thoughts of her
dwindling senior-class toward the subjects of their
graduation essays.
</p>

<p>
Swaying with the easy, languid grace of an
unstudied young animal, Mary Denbigh, the morning-session
ended, turned from the graveled walk before
the school-grounds into the little town's chief thoroughfare.
</p>

<p>
Nobody had ever called her pretty, but her light
serge skirt had that day been lengthened to her
ankles, and Mary was wholly conscious of the new
tokens of her growth.  Lithe, strong-limbed and
firm-bodied, of peasant stock and peasant vigor,
youth and health and the open country air were not
factors sufficiently unfamiliar to combine in a charm
that would attract admiration in her own community.
Only a jaded city-gaze&mdash;and a well-trained city-gaze
at that&mdash;would have seen in the blue eyes, the red
mouth, the straight nose, pink cheeks, and abundant
russet hair, any promise worthy of fulfillment,&mdash;could
have detected the flower in the bud; and that
such a gaze should, on this day of all days, have been
leveled in the girl's direction was, perhaps, only one
of those grim jests of a Fate that loves to play upon
the harmony between man and nature, and that here
observed the coming of a human spring that must
be brief and sudden, a human summer parching and
intense.
</p>

<p>
The usual group of idle residents and idling
commercial drummers were sitting at the plate-glass
window of the hotel as she went by, but the girl did
not see them.  Passing among objects of long
familiarity, she saw, in fact, nothing until, in a
side-street, she heard a rapid step behind her, was covered
by an approaching shadow and, half-turning, found
someone, a stranger, at her side.
</p>

<p>
"How d'y'do, liddle girl?"
</p>

<p>
Mary looked up; but she was quite too startled to
observe anything save that the speaker&mdash;she could
not have told whether he were man or boy&mdash;was at
once dark and rosy, smiling and serious, hat in hand,
and, beyond all speculation, no citizen of her own
borough.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know you," she said.
</p>

<p>
She flushed quickly, and strode forward.  It was,
she knew, no uncommon thing for the girls of her
acquaintance to be "picked up," as they called the
process, by some fellow-townsman that had never
been formally presented to them; but the process
was, as she also knew, one that lost its propriety
when extended to aliens.
</p>

<p>
The present alien was, nevertheless, not easily to
be dismissed.  He fell into her gait, and walked
facilely beside her.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your <i>par</i>don," he said in the humblest and
most unobjectionable tones.  "I don't mean to be
<i>rude</i> to you, honest, I don't.  I'm a traveling-man,
you see&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mary was striding rapidly ahead, her full mouth
now drawn firm, her blue eyes fixed on the
vanishing-point.
</p>

<p>
"I don't care what you are," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"All righd," he pleaded.  "All I vant now is a
chanc't to <i>exblain</i>.  I've chust started out traveling
for my fader, who's a big distiller in N'York.  I've
got to stay in this hole for a vhile, un' I'm not used
to the <i>bees</i>ness, un' I'm lonesome, un' I only
vondered if you vouldn't go vith me to a moving-picture
show, or something, this evening."
</p>

<p>
The best way to deal with such a situation is a
way that is easiest for the inexperienced and the
unpolished.  Mary was both.  For the first time
since he had begun to walk beside her, she now,
coming to a defiant stop, faced her annoyer.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know you," she repeated.  "I've told
you that onc't, and you'd better not make me tell
you any more still.  I live the second door round
the coming corner, and my pop is a puddler an'
weighs two hundred and ten pounds!"
</p>

<p>
Again she wheeled and again resumed her homeward
march; and this time she walked alone.  If she
heard, dimly, behind her a confused murmur of
response, she did not hesitate to learn whether the
words were expressions of further apology or new-born
dismay, and when she ran, flushed and panting,
up the three wooden steps to the two-story brick
house that was her home, though she could not then
deny herself one backward glance, that glance
revealed to her only an empty corner.  The pursuit
had ended.
</p>

<p>
She flung open the light door that was never locked
by day, walked down the short, darkened hall, past
the curtain of the equally darkened parlor, through
the dining-room with its pine table covered by a red
cotton cloth, and so into the small, crowded kitchen,
where her mother fretted and clattered above the
highly polished range.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Denbigh was a little Pennsylvania-German
woman, whom a stern religion and a long life of
hard work had not intellectually enlarged.  In spite
of the fact that she had borne eight children, of
whom Mary was the seventh, her sympathies had
failed to broaden, and her equally religious and
equally hard-working Welsh husband used often to
remark to her, during his one-monthly evening of
intoxication, that he was glad indeed she was to have
no more progeny, since, somehow or other, she
"seemed to git wuss tempered with every innocent
youngling as koom to 'un."  Whether this criticism
was or was not precise, it is at least true that much
drudgery had not improved the weary woman's temper;
that the long years before her husband rose to
his present wages&mdash;years during which his wife had
not only kept a house and reared a family, but had
also added to the communal income by night-work
as a dress-maker&mdash;had left her gray and stooped
and hatchet-faced; and that, though of a race in
which the maternal instinct runs almost to a passion,
her patience with her remaining pair of home-biding
children was frequently fragile and short.
</p>

<p>
Just now she looked up, a spoon in one hand and
a pan in the other, her forehead damp, as always,
with sweat, and her harassed eyes momentarily bright
with anger.
</p>

<p>
"Where on earth have you been, anyways?" she
shrilly inquired of Mary.
</p>

<p>
The girl's face instantly hardened from the
excitement of her recent adventure to the sullenness
behind which she always took refuge in these more
usual domestic crises.  What she might have
confessed had she come home to a less overworked
mother, it is, obviously, vain to conjecture; what
she actually did was to lock within her breast the
story that had been trembling on her red lips, and
what she replied to Mrs. Denbigh's question was an
ungracious:
</p>

<p>
"Been at school.  Where d'you think?"
</p>

<p>
The mother straightened up as far as her
long-stooped shoulders would permit.
</p>

<p>
"Think?" she echoed.  "I guess I can guess still
where you was.  'Less you was kep' in, you had
ought t' been home five minutes ago, an' nobody's
kep' in only five minutes.  You've been flirtin' with
some idiot of a boy on the street-corner yet&mdash;that's
about what you've been doin'!"
</p>

<p>
It was a random shot, and one fired from no previous
knowledge, but the girl at once realized that,
had any neighbor chanced to see what had actually
occurred, this parental construction would appear to
have some foundation in fact.  The thought was
enough to seal the locked gate in her breast.
</p>

<p>
"That ain't so!" she said, with childish fury.  "I
come straight home, like I always do.  If you want
me to help more with the work than I do help, why
don't you let me quit school?  I don't want to go
any more, anyhow."
</p>

<p>
There are some families in which the passing of
the lie is no such uncommon or serious offense, and
the Denbigh <i>ménage</i> was one of them.  It was, therefore,
upon the latter portion of Mary's speech that
her mother, at this time, seized.
</p>

<p>
"You'll go to school as long as your pop and me
say you must!" she retorted.
</p>

<p>
"You let our Etta quit when she was in the
grammar school," expostulated Mary, with an appeal
to the precedent of the successfully married
sister, who was now a next-door neighbor.  "You let
her quit then, and now I'm in the high."
</p>

<p>
Had Mrs. Denbigh's rejoinder been in accordance
with the facts, she would have said that all she
wanted to do was to give her daughter as much of
an education as was compatible with the proper
conduct of the Denbigh domestic economy.  But tired
women are no more apt to indulge in analytical
exposition than are tired men, and so it chanced that
her next speech, accompanied by a gesture that raised
the cooking-spoon aloft, was a torrent of words
unexpectedly interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"In the high?" she repeated.  "Well, I know
where you'll be in one minute, still, if you don't right
away&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She brought the spoon forward with a mighty
swoop, but its parabola, in crossing the stove, sent
it into violent contact with the pot that held the stew
destined for the noon dinner.  The pot was balanced
on the edge of an aperture in the stove whence the
lid had been removed.  The vessel fell, and its
contents belched upon the burning coals.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Denbigh gave one look at the steaming ruin,
and then seized the already retreating Mary.  The
girl's struggles, her cries, the dignity of the newly
lengthened skirt, avail nothing.  A dozen times
the mother's arm descended in stinging castigation,
and then she hurried her daughter into the
hall.
</p>

<p>
"You git right back to school!" she ordered.
"I don't care if you're a half-hour early&mdash;you're
mostly late enough.  You've spoiled your own dinner
and mine and little Sallie's, so you don't git
nothin' to eat still till evening.  You'll go to school,
and you'll keep on goin' till your pop an' me tells
you to quit!"
</p>

<p>
Mary looked at the woman without a word, and
then, still without a word, passed through the front
door and banged it behind her.
</p>

<p>
But she did not walk in the direction of the school;
she was not going to school.  The rebel-spirit of youth
choked her, and turned her feet, almost without will
of her own, toward the river.
</p>

<p>
She crossed the railroad tracks, came to the disused
towpath and followed it for a mile beyond the
town.  Far westward she went, "walking," as she
would have said, "her madness down," and, hungry
though she now was, she did not rest until at last,
as late as three o'clock in the afternoon, she sat on
a rock at the point where the Susquehanna curves
between the sheer precipice of Chicques on the
Lancaster County side and the hooded nose of the high
hill they call the Point, upon the other.
</p>

<p>
The flood of rebellion had ceased, but a steady
and enduring stream of resolution remained.
</p>

<p>
Across the sweep of eddies she saw the nearer hills
already shedding the browns and blacks of winter's
bared limbs and pine branches for the tenderer green
of a gentler season.  The cultivated portions of the
summits were already rich with coming life.  Behind
her rolled the Donegal Valley, where the crops
were even then germinating.  Birds were mating in
the sap-wet trees beside the water, and from the
flowering seeds there came the subtle, poignant scent
of a warm April.
</p>

<p>
Something&mdash;something new and nameless and
wonderful&mdash;rose in her throat and left her heart
hammering an answer to the new world around her.
She was glad&mdash;glad in spite of all her anger and
her hunger; glad that she had not told her mother
of the boy&mdash;for he must have been a boy&mdash;whom
she had, after all, so needlessly reprimanded; but
glad, above everything else, for some reason, for
some intoxication that she might neither then nor
ever after completely understand.
</p>

<p>
Her cheeks glowed a deeper pink; her blue eyes
glistened; she opened her red mouth to the seductive
sun and, with a sweep of her firm hands, flung loose
her russet hair to the breeze.  Looking out at the
distant fields, she sprang to her feet again and
walked, swaying with the easy, languid grace of an
unstudied young animal.
</p>

<p>
The fields reminded her of the rural prophets.
It was evident, she thought, that they were right:
this year's was to be a spring brief and sudden, a
summer parching and intense.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap02"></a></p>

<h3>
II
<br><br>
A DEED OF TRUST
</h3>

<p>
Mary Denbigh could not remember the
day when the holy estate of matrimony had
not been held up to her by others as the
whole destiny of woman and had not presented itself
as the natural, the easy, the sole path of escape
from filial servitude.
</p>

<p>
She belonged, as has been intimated, to a race in
which motherhood is an instinctive passion and an
economic necessity, and she was born into a class
in which not to marry is socially shameful and
materially precarious.  When she was very small, her
own dolls were her own children and her playmates'
dolls her children-in-law, and, when she grew older,
she had always before her the sedulously maintained
illusion of emancipation worn by those girls, but a
few years her seniors, who had given up the drudgery
of childhood, which she hated, for the drudgery of
wifehood, which they loftily concealed.  A young
wife was a superior being, whose condition was not
at all to be judged by the known condition of one's
mother, and all the other and more intimate relations
of marriage remained, to the uninitiate, a
charmed mystery.  If it seems strange to us that
this mystery and this innocence remained to Mary
at sixteen, the reflection rests not upon her from
whom the secret kept its secrecy, but upon us to
whom the innocence appears remarkable.
</p>

<p>
From a house that exacted everything and forgave
nothing, a narrow house, which she could not see
as simply an inevitable result of conditions as wide
as the world, the girl looked out to that wonderful
house next door where her sister had, only three
years before, been taken as a bride.  This sister was
now an elegant person, who said "fore-head,"
"of-ten," and "a-gain," but Mary could remember
Etta, in gingham frock and apron, performing the
tasks that were now enforced upon Mary herself.
And she could now observe&mdash;as, indeed, her sister's
wholly conscious pride well intended that she should
observe&mdash;Etta in clothes that were beyond the reach
of an unmarried daughter of Owen Denbigh; Etta
going to dances forbidden to a Denbigh maid.
When she climbed reluctantly to bed at ten o'clock,
Etta's lights blazed always wide awake, and when
she rose in the gray of the morning, Etta's shutters
were luxuriously closed.
</p>

<p>
Every dawn Mary must pack her father's dinner-bucket,
as Etta used to pack it, before Owen started
for the mill.  That done, and the hurried breakfast
eaten, she must make her own bed and wash the
dishes before she set out for school.  At noon there
were more dishes, and only every other evening,
before sitting down to detested study by the
kerosene lamp in the dining-room, was she relieved of
still more dish-washing by the growing, and
apparently too favored, younger sister, Sallie.
</p>

<p>
The evening that followed Mary's truant walk
along the river was one of those when she should
have been granted this modicum of relief, but now,
after the brief five o'clock supper, tow-headed Sallie
set up a wail as the table was cleared.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with you now?" demanded
Mrs. Denbigh, her harassed eyes blinking in the
lamplight, and her hatchet-face more than commonly
sharp.
</p>

<p>
"I ain't feelin' good," said Sallie.  "I'm tired;
I'm sick; I don't want to wash no dishes."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Denbigh shot a glance through the double-doorway
to the littered parlor; but the face of her
unattentive husband was hidden behind the crinkling
sheets of the <i>Daily Spy</i>, gripped by one great, grimy
fist, while the stubby forefinger of the other hand
spelled out the short syllables of the personal-column,
facetiously headed "Our Card-Basket."  His huge
bulk bulged over all the edges of the uncomfortable
patent armchair in which he was sitting: a picture
of gorged contentment, there was as yet no help to
be expected from him.
</p>

<p>
It was Mary, experienced in such attacks, who
made ready to defend the law.
</p>

<p>
"You ain't sick," she declared.
</p>

<p>
"I am, too!" sniffed Sallie.  "I'm awful sick!"
</p>

<p>
"Get out: you et more'n I did.  You just want
to make me do the work, an' I won't, 'cause it's
your turn.  So there!"
</p>

<p>
Mary's homecoming had, as it happened, not been
the signal for a renewal of hostilities between her
mother and herself.  The former had just then been
too hard at work to have either energy or thought
in that direction, and throughout the evening meal
the girl had deemed it wise to maintain a reticence
calculated to keep her in the domestic background.
Now, however, she had impulsively come forward,
and the step at once brought her to Mrs. Denbigh's
attention.
</p>

<p>
"After what you done this noon," she said to
Mary, "you'd better keep your mouth shut.  Go
and wash them dishes!"
</p>

<p>
But Mary knew that she had now gone too far
to retreat.
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't my fault the stew was spilled," she
protested; "and anyhow, you did lick me onc't for
that.  Sallie just wants to shove her work off on
me."
</p>

<p>
"I don't," blubbered Sallie.  "I'll do 'em some
evenin' when it's your turn."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Mary sneered, "I know how you will."
</p>

<p>
"I will&mdash;I will&mdash;I will so!"
</p>

<p>
Sallie's voice rose to a shrill shriek, and then
suddenly broke off in the middle of a note: there was
a sound of elephantine stirring from the parlor, and
the feared master of the house, moved at last from
his lethargy, rolled into the double doorway and
seemed nearly to block it.
</p>

<p>
One of the young reporters of <i>The Spy</i> had once
remarked&mdash;not in print&mdash;that Owen Denbigh resembled
nothing so much as the stern of an armored
cruiser seen from a catboat.  How much of the
covering of his powerful frame was fat and how much
muscle is matter for conjecture; his life in the iron
mills had certainly given him a strength at least
approaching the appearance, and had blackened his
large hands, reddened his big face, and grayed his
bristling hair and his fiercely flaring mustache.
</p>

<p>
"Whad's ahl this devil's racket?" he shouted, in
the voice he used in triumphing over the turmoil of
the puddling-furnace.
</p>

<p>
Both children quailed before him, each prepared
regardless of its merits, for acquittal or condemnation,
as he might decide the issue.  Even Mrs. Denbigh
drew back and set her lips to silence.
</p>

<p>
The giant raised a threatening hand.
</p>

<p>
"Be ye ahl gone deef?" he demanded.  "Whad's
ahl this devil's racket fur?"
</p>

<p>
In a panic of self-preservation, the two girls
began at once to clamor forth their woes.
</p>

<p>
"Sallie won't wash the dishes!" cried Mary.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sick," sobbed Sarah, "an' mom says Mary
must wash 'em because she upset the stew this noon-time!"
</p>

<p>
In the merits of any case brought before him, the
household Solomon was as little interested as if he
had been the judge of a law-court.  His years of
overwork had limited his sense of a just division of
toil among others, and his long oppression by
task-masters had made himself a merciless task-master.
Like the men that had driven him, he delighted most
in driving those who were the hardest to drive.
Sallie was too young to furnish appreciable resistance,
but in the awakening Mary he now saw something
that approached worthy opposition.  He turned first
to his wife.
</p>

<p>
"Did you tell 'er," he inquired, his stubby forefinger
leveled at Mary&mdash;"did you tell 'er to wash 'un?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Denbigh bowed her sweating forehead in
timid assent.
</p>

<p>
Then the father looked again at the offender.
</p>

<p>
"Wash 'un!" he ordered, and marched back to
his parlor, his armchair, and his evening paper.
</p>

<p>
Mary knew her father too well not to know also
the price of disobedience.  Sullenly, but without
hesitation, she retreated to the little kitchen and took
up her uncongenial task.
</p>

<p>
Girlhood, then, must be denied much of its claim
to recreation; the social machine was pitiless.  Young
life was a period of menial service from which the
sole escape was marriage, whether to stranger or
to friend.  That a stranger should harm her was,
to Mary&mdash;as it is to most girls of her age and
environment&mdash;an idea unentertained: strangers were
too few, and the world of moral fact too closely
shut and guarded.  Boys she had always been
cautioned against in vague generalities; but she
understood that they were prohibited because their
company was a delectable luxury reserved for older and
marriageable girls whose younger sisters were needed
only to help in the household tasks.
</p>

<p>
Rebellion once more reddened her heart&mdash;rebellion,
as she thought, against her own particular
condition, but the old rebellion, actually, that burns,
at one time or another, in every heart: the revolt of
the individual, more or less conscious of its
individuality, against the conditions that are combined
to crush it.  She poured the water from the heavy
iron tea-kettle into the tin dishpan with a quick
anger that was not eased when two or three of the
scalding drops leaped back against her bared, round
arms.  She flung the home-boiled soap after the
water, and she clattered the dishes as loudly as she
dared.  Through the window&mdash;her soul hot with
the sense of the injustice done her&mdash;she could see
the happy lights in Etta's house, and, her hands deep
in the greasy fluid, it came to her suddenly that she
had been a fool to neglect&mdash;to repudiate&mdash;to-day
what might have been the golden chance to such an
estate as her sister's.
</p>

<p>
She had heard the protesting Sarah sent to bed;
had heard her mother return to the parlor with the
sewing-basket, and, finally, as she was putting away
the last of the dishes in the china-closet in the
dining-room, she caught the voices of both of
her parents.
</p>

<p>
Dimly glimpsed from the small apartment beyond,
she knew the scene well enough to reconstruct it
perfectly.  The crowded little parlor was like a hundred
others in the immediate neighborhood, a mathematical
result of the community of which it was a part.
There were the two front windows with the horse-hair
chairs before each and, between them, the
marble-top table bearing the family Bible.  There was
the gilt mirror over the gorgeously lambrequined
mantelpiece, which was littered with a brass clock,
dried-grass-bearing yellow vases, stiff photographs of
dead or married younger Denbighs, and "memorial
cards" with illegible gilt lettering upon a ground of
black.  Close by the cabinet-organ on one side and
the green sofa on the other&mdash;the sofa adorned with
a lace "tidy" that would never remain neatly in its
place&mdash;her father and mother sat, separated by the
purple-covered center-table, their gaze interrupted by
the tall glass case that contained the bunch of white
<i>immortelles</i> from the grave of their eldest son.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Denbigh was finishing, it seemed, the narrative
of the town's latest scandal.
</p>

<p>
"I never knowed Mrs. Drumbaugh was that soft-hearted,"
the mother was saying.  "Nobody in town
was fooled over the reason for why her Jennie went
away, an' yet here the girl comes back a'ready, and
Mrs. Drumbaugh, church-member though she is,
takes her into the house ag'in&mdash;her an' her baby along
with her."
</p>

<p>
What was it in the words that brought Mary to
a sudden pause?  Her mother had always been, like
most drudges, a gossip, and had sought, in repeating
scandal about her acquaintances, that relief from
drudgery which she knew how to obtain only by this
second-hand thrill of evil.  The girl had heard and
disregarded the telling of many such a tale, and
yet, to-night, she stood there first listening in
uncomprehending horror to the narrative and
then awaiting the inevitable paternal comment
upon it.
</p>

<p>
"Tuke 'er bahk, hey?" rumbled Owen Denbigh.
"Well, ef she bay sooch a fule, she deserves the
scandal ov't.  Thank God no youngling o' ourn ever
went the devil's way.  I hahve ahlways bin sure what
I'd do to 'un ef she did, though."
</p>

<p>
He paused a moment, as if to have his wife inquire
as to the terrible punishment that he had reserved
for such an error, and then, as no inquiry was
forthcoming, he gave his statement at any rate, with all
the cold ferocity of a Judge Jeffries pronouncing
sentence.
</p>

<p>
"Bay 'un thirty year old an' noot another sin
ag'in 'un," he declared, "I would beat 'un within
a bare inch o' 'er deeth, an' turn 'un oot to live the
life 'un had picked fur herself!"
</p>

<p>
The whole intent of that speech Mary was
incapable of comprehending, but she understood
enough to tremble and then to fan to destructive fury
the fire of her rebellion.  Of a sudden, the
atmosphere of the house had become unendurable.  She
was gasping like a sparrow under a bell-glass.
</p>

<p>
Stealthily she crept into the hall.  Carefully she
took her coat and faded hat from the rack.  Very
gently she opened the front door and stole into the
street.  She felt dumbly that the world was wrong,
that youth should not have to work, and that to
seize the fruit of pleasure should not be matter far
punishment, but for congratulation.
</p>

<p>
I do not think that she meant to pass by the hotel
that evening.  I do not believe that most of us, in
such moments, are actuated any more by motive than
we are directed by discretion.  Nevertheless, when
the clutch of her emotions had enough loosened from
her throat to permit her to take account of her
whereabouts, the time, and the place, it was a quarter after
six by the town-clock; Mary was just before the
plate-glass window where the drummers sat, and,
only a minute later, the stranger of the morning was
again at her side.
</p>

<p>
"Von't you chust say that you're not <i>mad</i> vith
me?" he was asking.
</p>

<p>
She was so frightened that she was conscious of
no other definite sensation, much less of any ordered
thought or opinion; but she looked fairly at him, and
of what she saw she was immediately fully aware.
</p>

<p>
He was a young man, but the sort of young man
that might be anywhere from nineteen to thirty-two,
because he had the figure and the face of the former
age and the eyes and the expression of the latter.
The hair on his head was black and curly; though
his hands were not the working-hands with which
Mary was best acquainted, they were almost covered
with a lighter down of the same growth; and through
the pale olive of his sorely clean-shaven cheeks shone
the blue-black hint of a wiry beard fighting for
freedom.  His lips were thick when he did not smile
and thin when he did, with teeth very white; and
his gray glance had a penetrating calculation about
it that made the girl instinctively draw her coat
together and button it.
</p>

<p>
To his speech she could pay, just then, scarcely any
attention, except to feel that its quick, thick quality,
and its ictus on the vowels, denoted the foreigner;
but his clothes were a marvel that would not be
denied.  His coat and trousers of green were cut
in the extreme of a fashion that was new to her; his
brown plush hat was turned far down on one side
and far up on the other; his waistcoat, of purple
striped by white, was held by large mother-of-pearl
buttons, and his shoes, long and pointed, were the
color of lemons.
</p>

<p>
Impulsively she had refused an answer to his first
words; but the young man was a member of the
persistent race, and speedily followed the first speech
with a second.
</p>

<p>
"Chust say the vord," he pleaded, "und I von'
bother you no more.  I only vanted to make myself
<i>square</i> vith you."
</p>

<p>
Mary hesitated.  Something, she knew, she feared,
but whether it was the man, herself, or the habit of
obedience she could not tell.  He was polite, he was
respectful; he came, it was clear, from a happier
world than her own&mdash;and, as against her own she
was now in open revolt, a certain parley with this
visitor from an alien orb seemed likely to constitute
a fitting declaration of independence.  Conditions
had worked upon her to desperation, and the same
conditions, little as she guessed it, had, under the
mask of chance, inevitably provided this avenue of
protest.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she said, "I'm not mad at you, if that's
what you want to know."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad of that," he easily answered, as they
turned, quite naturally, away from the main street.
"But I thought you gonsidered me <i>fresh</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I hadn't never been introduced to you,
you know."
</p>

<p>
The young man laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I'll introduce myself!" said he.  "My name's
Max Grossman&mdash;not my real name, because I vas
born in Hungary an' nobody could say my real name
ofer here.  My fader is a big distiller in New
York&mdash;he's vorth half a million un' more: anybody'll tell
you about him.  'Und he's put me on the road for him."
</p>

<p>
This and much more he told her in the following
minutes.  He drew a truly brilliant picture of his
parental home, and, animadverting now and then
with scorn on the town in which he now found himself,
he painted in the highest colors the glory of
Manhattan.
</p>

<p>
New York, it appeared, was a city of splendid
leisure.  Its entire four millions of population spent
their days in rest and their nights in amusement.
There were the rumbling cable-cars, the roaring
elevated trains, the subway expresses, which reached out
and drew the Battery within twenty minutes of the
Bronx.  There were the realities that had been only
vague magic names to this girl: the East Side, the
Bowery, the Metropolitan Opera House, the Waldorf.
Nobody went to bed before three o'clock in
the morning, or woke before one in the afternoon.
Nobody was ugly and nobody was old.  There were
no books to study, no errands to run, no dishes to
wash.  There were only the cabs and the taxis to
ride in, the hundred theaters to see, the cafés and
the music, Fifth Avenue with its palaces, and
Broadway, from Thirty-fourth to Forty-third "von big,
yellow, happy electric lighd."
</p>

<p>
She listened.  As he spoke, though she did not
know it, the far-off orchestras were calling her, as
if the sound of the city deafened her to all other
sounds, as if the lights of New York blinded her to
the lights of home.
</p>

<p>
Her own story, as she in turn briefly told it to
him, provided her with the one touch of contrast
needed to make the lure of the new dream complete,
provided him with the one text necessary for the
implications he frankly wanted her to receive.  She
was already so metropolitan that, when she agreed
to go to the moving-picture show, she passed the
portals of "The Happy Hour," as the place was
optimistically entitled, with a superior scorn for all
that it had to offer.
</p>

<p>
The narrow hall was dark when they
entered&mdash;Max pocketing the large roll of yellow bills from
which he had drawn the price of their admission&mdash;and,
as they sat down, half-way toward the stage,
there was being shown, on the screen, the absurd
adventures of a tramp, who entered an ornate hotel
grill-room and who, among wondering, well-dressed
guests, was proceeding to order an elaborate meal.
</p>

<p>
"That's the <i>As</i>tor," whispered Max, loudly.  "I'd
know id anyvheres."
</p>

<p>
The pictured tramp was, of course, unable to pay
his score, and, equally, of course, was pursued as he
leaped through an open window.
</p>

<p>
Max acted as Mary's guide during the tableaux
of the chase that followed.  Now the quarry was
darting among the congested traffic of Times Square;
now he had clambered over the platform of a Forty-second
Street surface-car; now he was running up the
steep stairway of the Sixth Avenue "L," and now,
the hunters close at his heels, he was dashing along
Thirty-fourth Street past the Waldorf, turning down
toward the Park Avenue Hotel, and so, at last, was
caught at the nearby entrance to the subway.
</p>

<p>
When the lights flared up at the conclusion of
the little drama, Mary sighed as if suddenly plunged
from fairyland down to the real world below.  And
then the sigh changed to a gasp of fright: in the
same row, only six seats away, her sister Etta was
sitting.
</p>

<p>
The girl started to rise.
</p>

<p>
"Vhat's wrong?" asked the astonished Max.
</p>

<p>
"I must go.  Don't come out with me.  Wait a
minute, and then follow.  I'll be at the next corner
up street.  That's our Etta over there!"
</p>

<p>
But Max did not seem fully to comprehend the
warning.  He rose with Mary, and made some stir
in doing it, so that, as the pair reached the aisle,
Etta's eyes were drawn in the direction of her sister
and the man.
</p>

<p>
Mary, though she hastily turned her head, thought
that she saw recognition in this sudden glance.  She
thought that she saw recognition turn to amazement,
and amazement to rebuke.  Instantly, there rose
before her the reefs of ultimate domestic disaster.
With Max in close attendance, she hurried to the
door.
</p>

<p>
Outside she did not speak until they had reached
the comparative seclusion of a less frequented street.
Then she turned hotly upon the youth, whom she
considered the cause of her peril.
</p>

<p>
"Why was you such a fool?" she demanded.
"Didn't you hear me say for you not to come out
when I did?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't understand you," Max humbly expostulated.
"But vhat difference does it make, anyvays?"
</p>

<p>
"Difference?  Why, you were so blamed noisy
that Etta looked round an' seen me.  She'll go
straight home and tell pop I was here with you."
</p>

<p>
"Vell," protested Max, "it's not seven o'clock
yet, und I'm not eatin' you, vas I?"
</p>

<p>
"That don't matter.  You don't know my pop!"
</p>

<p>
"Vhat'll he do?"
</p>

<p>
"He'll"&mdash;Mary remembered previous punishments
for smaller offenses, and recalled the judgment
that she had heard her father pronounce on a
hypothetical offender.  "He'll beat me till I'm near
dead," she declared; "an' then, like as not, he'll
turn me out of the house."
</p>

<p>
They were at pause in the shadow of an old
buttonwood tree, Max leaning against the gnarled trunk,
the girl facing him, erect.
</p>

<p>
Even as she sketched her possible punishment, the
possible became probable.  She was afraid, and this
young man, who had been so deferential, so
protecting, who had given her so alluring a glimpse of
another world, seemed her only refuge.
</p>

<p>
He put out his hands and, gently, took both of hers.
</p>

<p>
At that touch the last of her anger melted, almost
to tears.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," he said.  "I've been decent to you,
haven't I?  I ain't tried to get fresh?"
</p>

<p>
She shook her head, not trusting speech.
</p>

<p>
"Vell, then, listen here," he pursued.  "If your
old man gets gay, chust remember <i>that</i>.  You ain't
treated righd at home, the best of times.  You said
so yourself.  Un' this here jay town's no <i>place</i> for
a pretty young lady like you, anyvays.  So, if there's
any trouble, you come for me, und I'll get you avay
from here."
</p>

<p>
The girl thrilled with a delicious sense of adventure.
She trembled with the foretaste of a new delight.
The passing praise of her looks and of her
newly acquired maturity, a novel sound in her ears,
was not lost upon her; but even that was dwarfed
by the tenor of her companion's words, and the
wonderful current that ran from his hands to hers.
Was this what had been meant, that truant afternoon,
by the calling birds, the leafing trees and the
poignant air along the river?  Was this what young
women felt when lovers told their love?  She could
not have formulated the questions, but her heart
asked them, and Max, meanwhile, was repeating:
</p>

<p>
"I'll get you avay from here!"
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;how could you do it?" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
"It'd be dead easy.  If there's any scrap, you
vatch your chanc't un' give the house the slip.  I'll
be vaitin' at the hotel till midnight.  Delephone me
from the nearest drugstore, un' ve'll take a trolley
down the line un' catch a train to N'York un' be
married there this same nighd.  I've a friend who's
a minister un' vill get out of his bed any hour I'd
ask him."
</p>

<p>
He pressed her hands tighter, and, as he leaned
against the tree, drew her slightly toward him.
</p>

<p>
But Mary, though she did not know why, still
fearful, held back.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;we couldn't do that," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Vhy not?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Because&mdash;why, we couldn't go away together,
alone: it wouldn't be right."
</p>

<p>
Max straightened suddenly.  He released her
hands and placed one tight arm about her waist.
</p>

<p>
"It vould be righd if I <i>lofed</i> you," he said.  "Und
I do lof you.  Ve city folk, ve can't do things
slow-like you liddle town people.  Vhen I saw you this
morning, I knew I liked you, because you vas so different
from all these rubes around here; un' vhen I talk
vith you this efenin' I know I lof you.  Listen here:
you come avay with me to-<i>nighd</i>.  Ve vill go righd
ofer to N'York, un' there ve get married righd avay.
No more school, nor dishvashin', nor scoldin'.  Your
own fader vill be pleased vhen it's ofer, because my
fader is reech, un' my fader vill be pleased too,
because he's been devilin' me to marry for more'n
a ye-ar, only I nefer till now found a girl I <i>lof</i>.
Come on, Mary: I lof you!"
</p>

<p>
Her eyes swam in a mist.  They had come then&mdash;love
and freedom, hand in hand.  Her soul grew
faint within her.  She struggled a little, fluttering
like a young bird in a capturing palm, but he drew
her tighter, and his free hand passed electrically
across her cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Come on avay!" he urged softly.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I don't know what to do!" she panted.
"Wait&mdash;wait "&mdash;it was the ancient cry of
womanhood upon the brink&mdash;"wait till to-morrow!"
</p>

<p>
There was a step behind them, which Max was
the first to hear.  He freed her, and they stood mute
until the shadowy passer-by had gone.  It was an
incident that at least lessened the spell.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it's all right," said Mary.  "Perhaps
Etta didn't see me, an' I can tell 'em I was over at
my girl-friend's."
</p>

<p>
"It's only puttin' off vhat's got to happen
<i>some</i>time," Max argued.  "This town's no place for a
girl like you."
</p>

<p>
He leaned toward her, but she drew, reluctantly,
away.  What might be well by day may well seem
ill by night.
</p>

<p>
"Wait till to-morrow, anyhow," she urged.&mdash;But
to-morrow, she wondered, how should she explain
her afternoon away from school?
</p>

<p>
Max considered.
</p>

<p>
"All righd," he at last nodded.  "Go home un'
think things ofer vith yourself; but I'll be chust as
ready to-morrow as I am to-day.  You've got to get
avay from all this ugliness.  Remember that, un'
remember I hafn't been <i>fresh</i>, un' I vant righd now
to marry you.  I hafn't efen tried to kiss you.  Think
of that, un' think that I'll be vaitin' up at the hotel,
in case of drouble, till <i>mid</i>nighd."
</p>

<p>
He wheeled at that, and left her.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later&mdash;at a quarter to seven, so rapidly
had the drama unrolled itself&mdash;she had reached
home to find that Etta had been there before her.
Denbigh, on the early morning shift that week, was
already in bed, but her mother tossed the truant into
the parlor and locked both doors while she went up
stairs to waken him.
</p>

<p>
He came down at once, in his nightshirt, roaring.
He turned the key and flung wide the door.
</p>

<p>
The room, however, was empty, and the window
open.  Mary and Max were already together, hurrying
through the warm spring evening toward the
trolley-car that was to carry them on the first stage
of their journey to New York.
</p>

III
<br><br>
THE SPECTER OF FEAR
</h3>

<p>
A sixteen an angry and frightened girl
running away from a home where the necessity
for work must cheat her youth of its just
rights&mdash;at sixteen such a girl cannot analyze her
emotions, and Mary's were in sheer panic.  She had
never before been farther from her own town than
the ten miles' distant county-seat, had never before
been at more than verbal odds with her parents.
Philadelphia had stood for the City of Lanterns,
and a quick retort for revolution.  Now she was
bound for New York and marriage.
</p>

<p>
There was none of the few persons on the trolley-car
that knew her, yet she kept her face to the window
and away from them.  There was no chance of
capture, yet she trembled whenever the brakes
creaked and a new passenger came aboard.  It might,
perhaps, be truly said that she did not feel at all,
and that the power of poignant realization was still
paralyzed by her own action.  It was as if she had
amputated a portion of her spiritual being, and wras
still numb from the shock.
</p>

<p>
Whatever Max's own feelings, he at any rate conducted
himself in the manner least calculated to rouse
his companion.  He spoke only to give the few
necessary directions, and then in a low tone, not facing
her, but looking straight ahead.  He had slipped
her the money to pay her own fare and, the better
to deceive whoever might follow them, had told her
to buy a round-trip ticket to a point beyond that for
which they were bound.  With his lemon-colored
shoes planted upon his suitcase, he sat beside her,
but he kept as wide a space between them as the
short seat would permit; and it was only under the
discreet covering of the light overcoat upon his knee
that he kept a tight and reassuring grasp of her firm
hand.
</p>

<p>
At a mile from the county-town they left the
car&mdash;Mary first and Max twenty yards behind&mdash;and
then, for the competent young man seemed to have
prepared for everything, walked across the fields,
under the stars, to a flag-station where, within a few
minutes, they could catch a New York express.  Arm
in arm they walked, but Max never once frightened
her by a burst of affection, never once did more than
to encourage her by plain statements of his loyalty
and more ornate descriptions of the life before
her.
</p>

<p>
"You vill <i>like</i> it," he concluded.  "I know you
vill be happy, Mary."
</p>

<p>
Mary's breath caught a little in her throat.
</p>

<p>
"Ye&mdash;yes," she answered.  "Only, I can't help
thinking some about mom."
</p>

<p>
"Sure you can't," Max immediately agreed.
"You mustn't led her vorry longer than you can
help it.  I tell you vhat ve'll do.  Ofer here in the
station, you wride her a letter und I'll haf it mailed."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but then pop would see it, an' he might
follow us!"
</p>

<p>
"Don' gif no names or say vhere ve're goin',
und how can he?  By the time he gets it, ve'll be
safe married, anyways.  Here ve are at the station.
I've got some paper un' pencil und an envellup: I'll
tell you chust vhat to wride."
</p>

<p>
He did tell her, and this note, given to the
train-porter, was mailed farther along the line:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"<i>Dear Mother</i>: Don't please worry about me.  I will soon be
back for a visit, only I have gone to Buffalo to get married.  He is
a nice young man and his father is rich, for I could not stand to
have Pop beat me, nor do other people's work any more.
</p>

<p class="letter">
  "Your aff. daughter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"MARY DENBIGH."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The train, which Max had duly signaled, had
stopped just as the writing was ended, and the pair
of runaways had hurried into the last seat of the
rear car.
</p>

<p>
During the journey that followed, Mary's nerves,
accustomed to early hours, gave way not to tears,
but to the exhaustion consequent upon the strain of
her crowded day.  Her hat in her lap, her russet
hair made a pillow for her against the sharp window-sill,
and, with Max's coat piled at the pane to protect
her from the keen arrows of the inrushing night
air, she lay back, the pink cheeks and the red mouth
paler than an hour since, and the blue eyes closed.
She did not seem to sleep, and yet it was in a dream
that the ride ended, in a dream that she found
herself one of a hurrying crowd stamping down the
platform and into the huge elevator at the Jersey
City station, in a dream that she clung faithfully to
Max's arm as the sudden lights and damp odors
struck her and as she dropped upon a straw-covered
bench of a swaying car, which shot them immediately
through a tunneled darkness into the very
depths of the earth.
</p>

<p>
She knew from her geography that New York was
separated from New Jersey by water.
</p>

<p>
"When do we cross the ferry, Max?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
Max smiled, his thin lips showing his white teeth
in sharp contrast to his olive skin.
</p>

<p>
"We're crossing it now," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"But where's the water?"
</p>

<p>
Max, mopping his dark forehead with a purple-bordered
handkerchief, pointed to the roof of the car.
</p>

<p>
"Up there," he said.  "Ve're in the tube, you know."
</p>

<p>
She did not know, but she was too much ashamed
of her rural ignorance further to discover it by
unconsidered questions, and so full of a pulsing wonder
at what was to come next, so full of the expectation
of the child at her first melodrama that she had
place for no backward thought.  She sat silent until
they had come out of the tunnel, climbed a windy
stair, and emerged upon a thoroughfare as much
ablaze as if all the stars of heaven had descended to
light it, and as brimming with moving life as her
father's mill at ten o'clock in the morning.
</p>

<p>
Max regarded the girl's open-eyed wonder.
</p>

<p>
"Now," he said, "ve'll chust chump in a taxi
un' go get a good supper, un' then, vhile the vaiter's
filling our order, I'll first do a little delephoning."
</p>

<p>
He put up his dark hand; a passing automobile,
its tin flag raised, hummed up to the curb, and Mary,
clinging timidly to the arm of her betrothed, began
her first ride in a taxicab.
</p>

<p>
The street&mdash;it was Fourteenth Street, he told
her&mdash;flared and seethed and spluttered before them.  As
if leaning over the head of a runaway horse, they shot
in and out among clanging cable-cars, dashed by
snorting vehicles of their own sort, and nearly grazed
jostling cabs driven by cursing Jehus.  Even at that late
hour, some of the shops were still open, and the wide
pavements on either side were black with countermarching
processions of people, moving with the steady
rapidity and stolidity of a swarm of ants.  When
the street ran by a tree-sprinkled square, its houses
seemed to burst into still greater brightness to atone
for the darkness of the park.  Every second building
was a restaurant, a theater for moving-pictures, or a
saloon.  Their electric-signs now winked from
nothingness to light, now flashed forth a word, one letter
at a time, and now were surrounded with wriggling
snakes of fire.
</p>

<p>
It came upon her&mdash;this vision of the absolutely
new, of the city's immensity and teeming life&mdash;at a
moment when her heart was ready for reaction, when
memory was prepared to reassert itself, and when,
anger gone and regret poised like a runner at the
starting-line, her quick determination might have
failed her.  But it came with stupefying force.  The
dream of pleasure gave place for the moment to a
certainty of dread.  Vaguely, unreasoningly, but with
the unquestioning acceptance of a child, she felt New
York as a terrible, solidified unity; as a vast, malevolent
consciousness; as a living prison that implacably
and resistlessly raised itself on every hand and on
every hand shut her in forever.
</p>

<p>
She trembled and clung the tighter to her companion's
arm, and her companion was alert to note her
agitation.
</p>

<p>
"Vhat's the matter?" he inquired, in a voice that
he well meant to be tender.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I don't know," she began, her red underlip
indrawn.  "I&mdash;aren't we goin' pretty fast?"
</p>

<p>
"Who?  Us?  Vhy, I was chust thinking I'd tell
him to hit up the pace a little.  Are you scared?"
</p>

<p>
Her pride would not permit confession.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," she lied; "I'm not scared."
</p>

<p>
"But you are shivering."
</p>

<p>
"I guess I'm kind of chilly."
</p>

<p>
"All righd.  Chust vait a minute un' ve'll soon be
at the restaurant un' varm up.  You'll like that
restaurant: it's von of the swellest in town."
</p>

<p>
"But it's pretty late," she ventured.  "Your
friend&mdash;are you sure he&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who?  The minister?"  Max patted her hand
with reassuring affection.  "Don't you vorry about
him.  He's all for me, und I'll get him out of bed
chust as soon as ve've ordered our supper."
</p>

<p>
A few blocks more, and Max, aided by a marvelously
tall person in a wonderful uniform, was helping
her, with what she considered an elaborate courtesy,
to dismount from the taxi, pass under a glass
awning and, through a changing stream of hurrying
waiters and arriving and departing guests terribly
arrayed, to climb a softly carpeted stair and enter
a brilliant balcony open to the street and full of
chattering men and women eating and drinking at
a score of tables.  Even in her fright, it was with
a touch of admiration that she observed how Max&mdash;her
Max&mdash;seemed to be known to the immediately
attentive waiters, and how, smiling, they hurried to
make way for him.
</p>

<p>
They secured a corner table, a relatively quiet
corner table, and there, with a servant standing by,
pencil in hand, and with a huge double-paged
menu-card before each of them, made ready for their
meal.
</p>

<p>
"Chust you order vhatever you like," said Max.
"Pretty near everything in the vorld's on there, but
if you vant anything that you can't see, chust you
ask for it."
</p>

<p>
Mary looked at the card.  In spite of all that had
passed, and all that now filled her heart, she was
young, and youth is so fortunate as to be able to
eat in the trough of any emotional sea.  She was a
child, and, by the sure logic of childhood, who-so
thought to feed her could be nothing but a
friend.
</p>

<p>
The card, however, was of small assistance.  Its
very size was appalling, and its offerings were made
in an unfamiliar tongue.
</p>

<p>
"You get what you like," she at last submitted.
"I'm so hungry I can eat anything."
</p>

<p>
He saw her difficulty so well that he could rescue
her from it without seeming to see it at all.
</p>

<p>
"Vell, I'm vith you there," he said cheerfully,
and proceeded to obey her, rattling off a list of
dishes of no one of which she had ever heard before.
"Un' have the Martinis dry," he cautioned in
conclusion, "vith a dash of absinthe in them&mdash;un' bring
them righd avay: I'm spittin' gotten."
</p>

<p>
The waiter left, and, as he did so, Max again
addressed the girl.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me for von minute," he said.
</p>

<p>
But Mary's blue eyes opened wide in instant alarm,
and she put a detaining hand upon his wrist.
</p>

<p>
"Don't!" she quavered.  "Don't go away!  I&mdash;I
don't want to be left alone."
</p>

<p>
Max laughed outright.
</p>

<p>
"Haf you forgot our minister?" he demanded.
"Ve don't vant to go to his house vithout first
giffin' him a chanc't to get some <i>clothes</i> on.  Efen up
your vay, the ministers vear a suit under their nighd-gowns
vhen they marry people."
</p>

<p>
She smiled faintly at his labored wit, and, as her
heart fluttered at this definite approach to the end
of her journey, permitted him to go.
</p>

<p>
Had he been absent for only the minute that he
had promised, the time would have seemed long to
the waiting girl, but he remained invisible for much
longer, and to Mary, watching the laughing, uncaring
strangers from another life, the terror of the
city in her soul and the sense of all that she had
done lurking in the shadows of her brain, the quarter
of an hour appeared to be four times that period.
Once she feared that he had met with some accident;
once she was saved from starting in search of him
only by the knowledge that, in so doing, she must
infallibly lose herself.  She would have made
inquiries of a waiter, but the waiters were too
imposing.  She would have cried, but she was afraid to
cry.  She would have ended, perhaps, by some utter
betrayal of all that was battling within her; but,
just when she was sure, for the thousandth time,
that she could endure no more, she saw Max coming
toward her from the long-watched door.
</p>

<p>
As soon as she noticed his strangely stern face,
the old fear gave place to a fresh one.
</p>

<p>
"What's happened?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
He pulled back his chair spitefully and flung
himself into it.
</p>

<p>
"These crazy laws of your America," he snarled,
"there ain't no sense in them!"
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" she repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Vhy, it's this way.  Of course, it don' make no
difference; it only puts things off till <i>mor</i>nin'; but
it's this vay: I got my minister friend on the 'phone,
un' he's all ready to marry us, only he says the law
says ve must haf a license from City Hall first, un'
if ve don't get von, he can go to chail because of
marryin' us vith<i>out</i> it."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Mary, "let's get a license."
</p>

<p>
Max spread forward the palms of his dark hands.
</p>

<p>
"How can ve?" he demanded.  "The City Hall
closes in the afternoon un' don't open till <i>mor</i>nin'."
</p>

<p>
Here, apparently, was tragedy.  Specific reasons
for its tragic elements the girl would, perhaps, have
found it hard to give, but that it was tragic she knew
instinctively.  Her blue eyes opened wide in fright.
</p>

<p>
"What are we to do?" she pleaded.
</p>

<p>
But Max, the resourceful, had been, it appeared,
only temporarily checkmated.
</p>

<p>
"I thought of that," he said.  "Ve can't get
married now till to-morrow; but my modder has a
good friend un' I delephone <i>her</i>.  She told me she'd
be glad to have you her guest ofer to-nighd.  I'll take
you there in a taxi, un' go home for my own sleep.
I'd take you vith me, but it vouldn't do to spring
a new vife on the family vithout varnin'.  Then I'll
have talked vith my own people, und I'll bring them
around to the veddin', first thing in the mornin'."
</p>

<p>
Mary, however, quailed.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to do that," she inconsequently
responded.  "I don't want to go to strange people's
alone."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't you vorry, now," Max soothed her.
"I'll go vith you for a liddle vhile un' see that you
make yourself at home.  This friend of my modder's
is a fine voman, un' she's <i>rich</i>.  She is Mrs. Légère.
She lives in a fine house: you'll like her."
</p>

<p>
He persisted in his persuasions, and, in the end,
he won her acquiescence.  After all, here were the
walls of the city about her, and she had no choice.
</p>

<p>
While they had been talking, the waiter had
returned and had placed before each of them one of
the stemmed glasses full of the pale yellow
concoction that Max had ordered.
</p>

<p>
"Vell," grinned the host, "here's happy returns
of the day un' many <i>of</i> them."
</p>

<p>
He took his glass in his hairy hand and flung the
contents down his throat.
</p>

<p>
But Mary looked at the drink in growing alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it whiskey?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"No-o-o!  I don't drink vhiskey.  This is only
vermout' un' tchin."
</p>

<p>
"Gin's just the same as whiskey," the girl protested.
</p>

<p>
"Not by a long sighd it ain't."
</p>

<p>
"It's liquor, anyhow."
</p>

<p>
"Sure, it's liquor; but drink a liddle of it; it vill
gif you an appetite."
</p>

<p>
Mary shook her russet head.
</p>

<p>
"I don't need no appetite," she said; "I'm half
starved as it is."
</p>

<p>
"You'll need something to grind up these here
Hungarian things, though."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Mary; "I'd rather not."
</p>

<p>
"But efferybody does here in New York."
</p>

<p>
"Then I guess I'll wait till I'm a regular New
Yorker."
</p>

<p>
"Don't your fader drink?"
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes he does," said the girl, conclusively;
"an' that's why I don't."
</p>

<p>
He urged her no further; he even denied himself a
glass of the wine that he had ordered, and he
succeeded, by this abstinence, in regaining whatever he
had lost of her faith in him.  He ate heartily
himself, and if his manner of eating was not precisely
that most common in restaurants of a more careful
sort, this was something that the girl would have
failed to note even had she not been so busily
engaged by wonder at the service and consumption of
the novel food.  It was not until, contentedly sighing,
she had sunk back from the wreck of her second ice,
that she remembered again the lateness of the hour.
</p>

<p>
With a display of his large bills and another flurry
of attendants, they left the restaurant, walking
among the gayly dressed and loudly laughing people
at the tables, passing down the heavily carpeted
stairs, and entering another pulsing motor-car.  Max
leaned out of the door and gave an address that
Mary did not hear; the chauffeur threw forward the
metal clutch, and the automobile shot ahead on its
journey.
</p>

<p>
They went for some time under the still hammering
elevated; then turned through a quieter and
darker street; threaded rapidly, twisting hither and
yon, a dozen other highways and byways and at
length drew up at their destination.  Max leaped
lightly to the pavement and tossed the driver a
bill.
</p>

<p>
"Neffer mind the change," he said, and had
scarcely helped Mary to dismount before the car had
snorted away into the night, leaving the pair of
young lovers in the scarcely broken darkness and in
a silence that seemed surrounded by a dim, distant
rumble of city-sound.
</p>

<p>
The girl could see little of her whereabouts.  She
observed only that she was in a slumbering block
of blinded dwelling-houses, a scene different from any
that New York had thus far presented to her.  One
distant, sputtering arc-light succeeded only in
accentuating the gloom; underfoot the way resounded to the
slightest tread; from the little patch of inky sky into
which the roofs blended above, a bare handful of
anæmic stars twinkled drowsily, and, on both sides,
from corner to corner, the uniform, narrow houses
rose in somber repetition, each with its brief, abrupt
flight of steps, each with its blank windows, each
seemingly asleep behind its mask.
</p>

<p>
More than this, indeed, Mary's tired eyes could
have had no time to observe, for Max's strong fingers
were at once curled under her armpit, and she was
hurried up to one of the innumerable mute doorways.
He pressed a button hidden somewhere in the wall,
and, almost immediately, the door swung open.
</p>

<p>
The pair looked from darkness upon a rosy twilight.
Under the feeble rays of the pink-shadowed
stairway, there were just visible the outlines of a
full-blown form.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Rosie!" cried Max as, quickly snapping
the door behind him, he passed by his charge and
seized an invisible hand.  "You vaited up for us
un' come to the door yourself!  That vas good of
you."
</p>

<p>
In spite of her Gallic cognomen, Mrs. Rose
Légère replied in the tone and vernacular of
Manhattan Island.
</p>

<p>
"Sure I waited for you," she answered.  "But
don't talk so loud: you'll wake the whole
family.&mdash;And is this the little lady, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Half disposed to resist, Mary felt herself gently
propelled forward by Max, and then enveloped in
an ample, strangely perfumed embrace, while two
full warm lips printed a kiss upon her cool young
cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Come into the back parlor," said Rose Légère,
lightly seizing the girl's hand.  "I want to get a
look at the bride."
</p>

<p>
She led the way past the closed double doors of the
front room on the ground floor, and into a rear
apartment that, though not brilliantly illuminated,
was far better lighted than the hall.
</p>

<p>
It was a room the like of which Mary had never
seen, decorated in colors that outshone the rainbow
and filled to overflowing with furniture that, to the
undiscriminating eyes of the girl, gave it the air of
a chamber in the Cave of Monte Cristo.  Gilt-framed
pictures of beautiful men and women&mdash;she
supposed they must be Grecian men and women&mdash;flamed,
in more than lifelike hues, from the crimson
walls.  The tall lamp on the blue-clothed table was
shaded in red; the thick rug flowered gorgeously;
the deep chairs were upholstered in pale brown, and
the lazy sofa on which, as Max closed the inner door
upon their entrance, Mrs. Légère seated herself with
her guest, was stuffed with soft pillows of
bewildering radiance.
</p>

<p>
Nor, when Mary came to look at her, did the
hostess seem out of keeping with her surroundings.
To the girl's home Owen Denbigh had once brought
a large, lithographed calendar, issued by a brewery,
and depicting, at its top, a woman of the elder
Teutonic days, very red and white, with long yellow
hair, and a body of rounded proportions, which
threatened to grind to powder the rock on which she
sat, and desperately endangered the filmy garments
that enfolded without clothing her.  It was of this
picture that Mary instantly thought when she got
her first full view of Mrs. Légère.
</p>

<p>
The hostess was clad in a long, fluttering,
baby-blue kimona, spotted by embroidered white dragons,
with sleeves that fell despairingly from her puckered
elbows, disclosing thick white arms with rolls of fat
at the wrists, and plump hands and fingers the
almond shaped nails of which gleamed like the points
of daggers.  The folds of light silk, held by a large
amethyst pin at the base of her sturdy throat, bulged
broadly over her capacious breasts and trailed, across
frou-frouing lace, far beyond her heels.
</p>

<p>
All this Mary saw first, and then, looking upward
across the figure that, literally, overshadowed her,
she saw a large, round, good-enough-natured face,
surmounting a white double chin.  The corn-colored
hair was massed in an intricate maze of puffs and
coils and braids, which made the girl wonder how
much was its owner's natural growth and how much
was due to the artifices that Mary had always longed
for and had always been denied.  The forehead was
low and calm; the violet eyes of a more than natural
brightness, with crowsfeet beside them and pouches
below, only just discernible in lamplight.  The brows
and lashes were of a blackness that contrasted with
the coiffure; the skin, here like snow and there as
red as roses, and the full, easy-going mouth as
crimson as a wound.  Mary thought that here at last
was a beautiful woman.
</p>

<p>
"I sure am glad to see you," purred Mrs. Légère,
as, having divested the guest of hat and coat, she
whisked these into the hall and, returning, again
seated herself and fondled the visitor's passive, but
flattered, hand between her own extensive,
well-cared-for palms.  "Max raved about you over the
telephone&mdash;just raved&mdash;and, now that I get to a clinch
with you, I begin to think that he knew what he
was talking about."
</p>

<p>
Max was seating himself on an orange-colored
ottoman opposite them.  He grinned broadly, his
narrowed lips showing his even, sparkling teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Sure I knew vhat I vas talkin' about," he declared.
</p>

<p>
Mary was not used to compliments, but she was
too honest not to show that she liked them.  She
blushed, and was all the prettier for it; but she did
manage to deprecate the sentiments of the better
known of her critics.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Grossman is crazy," she modestly observed.
</p>

<p>
"About you he is," said Mrs. Légère; "and,"
she added, "I doo't blame him.&mdash;But look here"&mdash;she
placed a crooked forefinger under the girl's chin
and turned the blushing face upward&mdash;"look here,
what a tired little woman it is!&mdash;Max, you're so
careless, I'll bet you've never thought to give this
poor child a drop of wine to strengthen her after
all that traveling!"
</p>

<p>
"I tried to get her to," said Max, "but she
vouldn't take it."
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't drink," explained Mary.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you don't, but," Mrs. Légère elucidated,
"taking a glass or two of wine after a railroad
ride isn't drinking."
</p>

<p>
"No-o," Mary granted; "but I don't care for it."
</p>

<p>
"I hope not&mdash;only taken this way it's medicine.
I don't blame you for not drinking in a restaurant
with a bad boy like Max; but you need it now; you're
all played out.  This is as good as your home till
to-morrow, you know.  Just have a little with me;
I'm old enough to be your mother, and we won't give
Max a drop&mdash;just to punish him.&mdash;Cassie!"
</p>

<p>
She had run through the speech with a rapidity
that had left the girl no chance for reply, and now,
before Mary could move her lips, she had, with
amazing agility, leaped to a back door, opened it,
called an order into the darkness beyond, and as
quickly returned to her former position on the sofa.
</p>

<p>
"It will be the best thing in the world for you,"
she said.  "The doctor orders it for me, and so I
always have it ready on ice."
</p>

<p>
As she concluded speaking, the door through
which she had called was reopened and there entered
a tall, raw-boned, glum, colored girl, whose shining
ebony skin was darkened by the white apron that she
wore.  She bore a tray on which was a gilt-topped
bottle and two narrow glasses.
</p>

<p>
"Put it there, Cassie," said Mrs. Légère, pointing
to the table.
</p>

<p>
The girl obeyed and left the room.  Max seized
the bottle, ripped off the gilding and, wrapping his
purple-bordered handkerchief about the neck, with
one dexterous twist, drew out the resounding cork.
</p>

<p>
A living foam gushed from the neck as the
self-appointed butler poured into the two glasses a pale
gold fluid, which creamed angrily to their edges,
and then subsided until first one addition and then
another set them boiling again.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Légère took a glass in each hand and pressed
the foremost into the passive palm of the girl.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said she, in a phrase new to Mary,
"here we are."
</p>

<p>
Mary hesitated, the glass to her lips.  She could
hear the liquid whispering to her, and particles
seemed to jump from it and sting her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Vine," said Max.
</p>

<p>
"But what kind of wine?" she weakly delayed.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," her entertainer informed her, "there
is only one kind of wine in New York."
</p>

<p>
"It's tchampagne," hissed Max, as if the name
were something too sacred to be spoken in the tone
of ordinary conversation.  "Un' this kind costs
eighd dollars a bottle."
</p>

<p>
The words and the connotation had their lure.
Champagne&mdash;she had heard of it as the beverage
of the rich; and eight dollars for one bottle&mdash;the
price of two winter dresses!
</p>

<p>
"Come on," smiled Mrs. Légère.
</p>

<p>
The girl still hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Here's to the wedding!" prompted the hostess,
and drank the entire contents of her glass.
</p>

<p>
Mary took a mouthful and swallowed it.  At
first she nearly choked.  Then the fiery liquid brought
fresh tears to her blue eyes, still smarting from the
gas that had, a moment before, assailed them.  But
finally, there began to spread through her weary
body a grateful glow, and, half in apology for what
she feared had been a clownish exhibition, she looked
up with red lips pleasantly parted.
</p>

<p>
"Now, wasn't I right?" inquired Mrs. Légère.
"Don't you feel better already?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I believe I do, thank you," Mary admitted.
"Anyhow, it is pretty good, I guess&mdash;when you get
used to it."
</p>

<p>
She took, bravely and with an ease now gained
by experience, a second drink, and, as she held the
glass before her, Max gallantly replenished it.
</p>

<p>
A bell rang and the glum, ebony maid passed
through the room, closing both doors behind her.
</p>

<p>
Mary, alarmed at this nocturnal interruption,
started a little, but neither of her companions seemed
to regard the incident as unusual.
</p>

<p>
"You look much better," Mrs. Légère asseverated.
"Finish that glass, dearie, and you'll be
all to the good again."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I'd better take so much?"
</p>

<p>
Both Max and Mrs. Légère laughed unaffectedly.
</p>

<p>
"Vhy, there ain't enough here to hurt a baby,"
declared the former.
</p>

<p>
Mary accepted the assurance.  She did not like
the taste of the champagne, but she knew now that
she had been very tired, and the wine sent fresh life
and energy through her sleepy limbs.  She emptied
the glass and felt, joyfully, all her fears and regrets
slipping for her.  Doubt and difficulty were resolved
into a shimmering mist, were overcome, were forgotten.
</p>

<p>
The black maid thrust her head in at the hall-doorway.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Légère rose.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me," she said, leaving the room.  "I'll
be right back."
</p>

<p>
Max, the instant she was gone, rose in his turn.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to fool her," he said.  "I'm going
to graft her drink!"
</p>

<p>
He took the glass that his hostess had placed upon
the table, poured more of the wine into it, replenished
the glass of his now unresisting companion and sat
down by her side, his arm stretched behind her.
</p>

<p>
Mary, with refreshed courage, broke the silence.
She was feeling like a naughty child triumphantly
successful in her naughtiness.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, Max," she said, "I gave a jump
when that bell rang?  I thought for a minute they
might be after us."
</p>

<p>
"Nix on that," chuckled Max.  "They couldn't
catch us if they tried.  Here's to the runavays!"
</p>

<p>
They clinked glasses and drank.
</p>

<p>
"I guess," the young man pursued, "it was chust
von of Rosie's boarders."
</p>

<p>
"Her boarders?  Does she run a boarding-house?"  There
was a note of dignified scorn in
Mary's climbing voice.
</p>

<p>
"Sure she keeps boarders."
</p>

<p>
"But I&mdash;&mdash;"  Mary hesitated.  She was tasting
wine for the first time in her life, she had been tired
and nerve-wracked, and now, though thoughts
danced through her mind with unfamiliar rapidity,
utterance seemed to her suddenly, and somewhat
amusingly, to have become too clumsy to keep pace
with them.  "I thought," she elaborately persisted,
"that&mdash;you&mdash;said&mdash;she&mdash;was rich."
</p>

<p>
"She is," said Max; "only she's got a big house
she can't all use herself.  Lots of people fill their
houses that vay in N'York."
</p>

<p>
Mary started to formulate a reply that came
glistening along the dim horizon of her mind; but
just then there was a light tap at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Come in!" called Max, and Mrs. Légère re-entered.
</p>

<p>
The precaution of her hostess forced a smile from
Mary.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you knock?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Légère shook her corn-colored locks
wisely.
</p>

<p>
"I don't ever disturb lovers," she said.
</p>

<p>
She sat down opposite the pair she was addressing
and, without noticing that Max had appropriated
her glass, discovered a fresh one on the mantelpiece,
poured herself a mouthful of the wine and then
decanted the rest for Mary.
</p>

<p>
She had just put down the empty bottle when the
bell rang a second time.
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord," she sighed, "there it goes again!
These people will be the death of me, losing their
keys and coming in at all hours.  Never mind,
Cassie," she called through the rear door, "I'll go
myself!"  And then, to Mary, she concluded: "I'll
attend to this and then I'll come right back and send
Max home and show you to your room."
</p>

<p>
She left them seated on the sofa, Max's dark hand
encircling the soft, young fingers of the girl as gently
as if he had been a rustic wooer.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I go graft another bottle from the
<i>kit</i>chen?" he asked, grinning impishly.
</p>

<p>
Mary shook her russet head.
</p>

<p>
"Not for me," she said; "I guess I've had enough."
</p>

<p>
Max again refrained from insistence.  Instead, he
remained beside her, and fell once more into the story
that she had learned best to like,&mdash;the beautiful
pictures of the wonderful city, of the work-free life
that she should lead there, and of their marriage on
the fast approaching morning.
</p>

<p>
Gradually, as his voice ran smoothly on, the words
he was then saying became confused in her brain with
other words that he had said earlier in the evening.
Her eyelids grew heavy.  The mood of exhilaration
passed, and a weariness far more compelling than
that from which she had previously suffered stole
upon her.  Mrs. Légère was absent for an
unconscionable time.  The girl yawned.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder when she's comin' back," said Mary,
"I'm&mdash;I'm awful tired."
</p>

<p>
Max's hand slipped to her unresisting head and
pressed it down upon his shoulder.  He had not yet
so much as kissed her, and he did not kiss her
now.
</p>

<p>
"Don't vorry about her," he said softly.  "You're
tired out.  Chust close your eyes for a minute, Mary,
un' I'll vake you vhen she comes."
</p>

<p>
His shoulder was very comfortable.  She closed
her blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You will wake me?" she murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Sure I vill," said Max.  "I'll have you clean
avake before she's through knockin'."
</p>

<p>
But he must have forgotten that promise, for when
Mrs. Légère at last returned, he was still sitting
there among the pillows, Mary's hair fallen over his
green coat, her cheeks pinker than ever, and her girlish
breast rising and falling rhythmically in sleep.
</p>

<h3>
IV
<br><br>
AWAKENING
</h3>

<p>
Clinging to a gigantic pendulum, Mary
was swept through a mighty curve of roaring
darkness, up from the black chasm of
insensibility, and tossed, swaying over that frightful
cliff, to the precipitous crag of consciousness.  For
what seemed many minutes, she tottered on the verge,
dizzy, afraid.  Then white knives, swift and sharp,
slashed at her eyes and forced up the lids.
</p>

<p>
Defying closed blinds and drawn chintz curtains,
the sunlight of noonday beat upon her face.  She
pulled something between her cheek and the leaping
rays.  Her hand trembled.
</p>

<p>
At first she could neither think nor recollect.  The
blows of an ax, regular, tremendous, were splitting
her head.  Her throat was hot and dry and choking.
Her stomach crawled and leaped with nausea.  From
head to foot she was shaking with recurrent nervous
chills that wracked a body of which every muscle was
strained and sore.
</p>

<p>
Realization of the present came slowly, but it
preceded all memory of the past.  She found that
the thing with which she had instinctively shaded her
eyes was a sheet, and, as she lowered it, she saw,
in a glance where the employment of sight was a
separate pain, that she was lying among large pillows
in a big brass bed, heavily mattressed.  Beyond the
foot of the bed her survey could not extend, because
the foot was high and hung with a pink and green
down quilt; but between two windows against the
wall to her right, she saw a bureau, bearing a few
scant toilet articles, and opposite, on the left, there
was a washstand with a basin on the floor before it
and, on its top, a pitcher, a soap-tray, a small brown
bottle, and a little blue box bursting with white
cotton.
</p>

<p>
This was not the room in which she had first fallen
asleep.
</p>

<p>
With that isolated fact flashing like a message of
disaster through her brain, she sat suddenly upright
in the bed; but the room pitched before her like a
boat in the trough of a storm on the river at home.
A wave of sickness hissed over her, and she sank
back among pillows repellantly scented.
</p>

<p>
Vaguely she realized that she must be in a room
somewhere above the ground floor.  Dimly she
began to wonder how she had got up the stairs.  What
would the kindly Mrs. Légère think of her condition?
And that which had happened&mdash;had it lasted
for an hour or a night?
</p>

<p>
That which had happened&mdash;there memory, in a
blinding blast, reasserted itself.  What had been but
half-wittingly accepted was now wholly known.  Hot
irons were branding upon her brain the full history
of all that had occurred: the deeds for which she had
at last learned the name, and the deeds that, even
in her own frightened soul, were nameless.  There
was nothing&mdash;nothing of her, hand and foot, and
mouth and eye and soul&mdash;that was not defiled.
</p>

<p>
For herself, for Max, but most of all for the
hideous facts of life, she shook in physical disgust.
Before the face of such things, what must birth and
marriage mean?  She opened her eyes, but she could
not look at her silent witnesses; she shut her lids,
but she saw, behind them, the hairy arms of a gorilla
closing on her, to break her and bear her away.  For
one moment, all that she had loved she hated, and
for the next, seizing his smiling reassurance as the
one vow that could legalize what nothing could refine,
all that she had come to hate she tried to force
herself to love.
</p>

<p>
She understood now so much that she had never
understood before: the whispered words of town
gossip, the stray glimpses of lovers in the summer
lanes, the cautions and the commands that had once
so galled her in her home.
</p>

<p>
At the word, her mind swung back to far-away
yesterday.  She was sorry that she had been the
cause&mdash;for she had been the cause&mdash;of the spilling
of the stew.  She was sorry that she had been so
sharp with Sallie.  She wished that she had washed
the dishes less unwillingly.  She still feared&mdash;she
more than ever feared&mdash;the swaying bulk of masculinity
that had been her father, but she began to see
in him the logical result of forces that were
themselves, as yet, beyond her ken; and she looked with
a new and pitying vision upon the picture of her
little, work-worn and care-marked mother stooping
over the polished kitchen-stove.
</p>

<p>
Her breast tossed and her throat throbbed; but she
was beyond tears.  Painfully, slowly, yet with resolution,
she struggled back to her sitting-posture in the
bed.
</p>

<p>
In this position she found herself facing a long
mirror hung against the opposite wall, and in the
mirror she saw what was herself.  With a low cry,
she pulled loose the sheet and covered her nakedness.
</p>

<p>
That done, she looked again at the strange face
that fronted her: a face the more strange because it
was the intimate become alien, a ruin, an accusation.
Framed in a tangle of dank hair, the cheeks, once
pink, were chalky now, and splotched with red, the
mouth that she had known only as full and firm, was
loose and twisted; the eyes that had been blue, now
circled with black, burned in blood-shot fields like
coals of angry fire.
</p>

<p>
One impulse alone directed her: to find her clothes;
to put them on; to return, as far as the mask of
appearances would take her, to the self that she had
been.  In spite of aching head and quivering hands,
she wrapped the sheet about her and, with infinite
care, got from the bed.  The floor seemed to sweep
up to meet her, but she steadied herself against the
wall and, each timid stride a separate agony, began
to stumble about the room.
</p>

<p>
She looked for a clothes-closet or wardrobe, but
there was neither.  The only door was the door of
exit, and the nearest chair was empty.  In a corner
she saw a pile of linen: laboriously she stooped and
picked it up, unrolled a portion, and then, gasping
in horror, tossed it away.  On the other chair there
lay a long kimona of crimson.  She lifted it and
found, neatly arranged below, a sheer cambric garment
edged with coarse lace, two black silk stockings
slashed with red, and a pair of slippers, high-heeled,
with buckles of brass&mdash;for no reason that she could
have formulated, the sight sickened her.  She went
to the bureau and tugged at its drawers, but all that
she found was a single brown bottle, like that she
had first observed on the washstand, filled with white
tablets and labeled "Poison."  Obviously, her clothes
had been taken from the room.
</p>

<p>
In a panic of shame, she groped blindly for the
door: she must call for Mrs. Légère.  She grasped
the knob and turned it&mdash;the door was locked.
</p>

<p>
Fear, mad and unreasoning, drove its spurs into
her sides.  Forgetting her nausea, heedless of her
pain, she ran first to one window and then to the
other, but the bowed shutters, though they admitted
the light, would open for nothing beside: they were
fastened with riveted loops of brass, and, looking
through the small space between them, she could
catch only a glimpse of the street far below.  She
tried to argue that the key might have fallen from
the lock within the room, but she could not find it,
and, the sheet dropping from her shoulders, she
began to rattle at the knob, and then to pound upon
the panels, her voice rising swiftly from a low call
to a high, hysterical, frantic cry for help.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Légère!  Mrs. Légère!  Mrs. Légère!"
she cried, and then as suddenly ceased, tilted against
the door, and collapsed into a naked heap upon the
floor.
</p>

<p>
All power of movement seemed to have slipped
from her, but when there came a heavy footfall on
the stair, a swish of skirts outside and the loud
rasping of a key inserted in the lock, Mary leaped
galvanically to her feet, gathered the sheet about her
body, and flung herself upon the bed.
</p>

<p>
The door opened and closed behind Rose Légère,
who promptly relocked it and slipped the key into
the swelling bosom but half concealed by her
dragon-spotted, baby-blue negligé.
</p>

<p>
"What in hell's the matter with <i>you</i>?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
A little more rotund of figure, a little looser in
the cheeks, and more patently crayoned and powdered
about the eyes, a little more obviously painted
and a little older, she was still the woman of the
brewery's advertisement.  But her forehead was
knotted in deep, angry wrinkles; her under jaw was
thrust so far forward that the roll of fat beneath
it was invisible, and her eyes snapped with malice.
</p>

<p>
Mary shrank back among the pillows.
</p>

<p>
"Weren't you yellin'?" persisted Rose.  "Did
you lose your voice doin' it?  What in the hell's the
matter with you, I say?"
</p>

<p>
With a sweep of her stout arm, she seized the
girl's bare shoulder and shook it till Mary's teeth
clicked like castanets.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not goin' to have any such racket in my
house!" the woman asseverated, as she plied her
punishment.  "You've got to learn first-off to keep your
mouth to yourself, and be dead sure if you don't I'll
give you a real beatin'."
</p>

<p>
She tossed Mary from her, as if her victim had
been a bundle of straw, and stood up again, arms
akimbo, breathing scarcely beyond her normal speed.
</p>

<p>
Mary was half mad and wholly sick with dread.
She wanted to cry out for rescue and dared not.  She
wanted to rise and try to force the door or break open
the shutters, but she could not move.  She could only
lie there panting for breath, with her mouth gasping
and her heart hammering at her breast.  She had
closed her eyes.  She opened them just in time to
see Rose, whose slippered foot had touched something
on the floor, stoop, pick up, and place beside the key
in her bosom, a crumpled purple-bordered handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
"Now then," said the woman in a tone that, if
still hard, was at least less intense than its
predecessor, "try to tell me what's the trouble, like
somebody this side of Matteawan."
</p>

<p>
With a supreme lunge at courage, Mary got her
voice.
</p>

<p>
"I want my clothes," she said dully.  "And
where's Max?"
</p>

<p>
"Your clothes ain't fit to wear," said Rose; "an'
I don't know where Max is.  What you need is
breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"I want my clothes," monotonously repeated
Mary.  "I couldn't eat to save my life.  Hasn't
Max come back?"
</p>

<p>
But Rose did not seem to hear the question.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, honey," she said, her anger seeming
now entirely passed.  "Of course you must eat.  I
got up on purpose for it, and I've set that nigger
cooking a perfect peach of a breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"I want my clothes."
</p>

<p>
Rose leaned over the bed and put a soothing hand
upon her questioner's fevered forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Now don't lose your nerve, dearie," she advised.
"I'm your friend&mdash;honest, I am.  You rest awhile
and eat a little, and then maybe we'll talk things
over."
</p>

<p>
"He hasn't come yet?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he hasn't.  But why are you lettin' that jar
you?  Perhaps he's sick, too.  Perhaps he's had some
kind of a scrap with his old man.  How do I know
what's hit him?  He'll show up all right in the
end and, till he does show up, you just make yourself
at home here and don't bother.  I'll take care of
you."
</p>

<p>
Something in the woman's solicitude&mdash;or it may
have been the quick and unexplained change from
violence to tenderness&mdash;frightened Mary even more
than the initial outburst had frightened her.
</p>

<p>
"I want to go home," she quavered.
</p>

<p>
"Sure you want to go home," Rose acquiesced,
without moving a muscle.  "But how can you go?
Max told me you'd sent your people a note saying
you'd hiked out with him to be married, and how
can you go home until he gets back here and you
can take him along and show the goods?"
</p>

<p>
Her tone was lightly argumentative, but it was
also stolidly merciless, and it hurled true to its mark
the shaft of conviction.  Out of the yesterday, Mary
heard the voice of her father that was the voice of
a society rigidly shaped by the conditions of its own
fashioning:
</p>

<p>
"Bay 'un thirty year old an' noot another sin ag'in
'un, I would beat 'un within a bare inch o' 'er deeth,
an' turn 'un oot to live the life 'un had picked fur
herself!"
</p>

<p>
She understood that statement now.
</p>

<p>
"I can go to Max's," she hazarded.
</p>

<p>
"To&mdash;<i>where</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"To Max's father's."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe you can; but it's a long trip to Hungary."
</p>

<p>
Mary answered nothing.  Rose had only confirmed
what the girl had for an hour feared.
</p>

<p>
"You see how it is," pursued Rose, reading
Mary's silence with a practiced mind.  "Better let
me take care of you."
</p>

<p>
Mary's face was hidden.  Again she felt New
York as a malevolent consciousness, a living prison
implacably raising around her its insurmountable
walls.  There was, she thought, nothing left her but
the diminishing hope of Max's return.
</p>

<p>
"Now you will eat, won't you?" Rose was continuing.
</p>

<p>
Mary shook her head.
</p>

<p>
Rose patted quietly one of the clenched hands that
lay close to her.
</p>

<p>
"Better do it, dearie," she said.  "I'm your
friend; remember that.  You can have whatever you
want."
</p>

<p>
Mary mastered what strength remained to her.
She raised herself on her elbow.
</p>

<p>
"Then let me go!" she pleaded, extending an
open palm like a beggar asking for a crust.  "I
don't care if my clothes is mussed.  I don't care
what'll happen afterward.  Just let me go!"
</p>

<p>
"You're a fool," Rose made cool rejoinder.
"Where'd you go?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know?"
</p>

<p>
"What'd become of you?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't care."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you would care, all right, all right.  You
can't go home, and you've no clothes and no money
and no references.  You couldn't get work anywhere
in New York, and you couldn't get away from New
York."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;&mdash;"  Mary groped through the darkness of
her soul.  "I can do housework."
</p>

<p>
"Not without a reference you can't."
</p>

<p>
"I could go to some office&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If you went to any charity-joint, they'd throw
you out because of what's happened to you."
</p>

<p>
"I could beg on the street if I had to."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think the men in this town give money
for nothing to a good-looking girl?  You could go
on the street, that's what you could do."
</p>

<p>
The phrase was new to its hearer, but the tone
explained it.
</p>

<p>
"Then," she stumbled forward, "I could go to
the police.  They'd help me.  I could&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But at that word Rose flew into a torrent of anger
and abuse that dwarfed the former tempest.
</p>

<p>
"You could, could you?" she cried.  "That's
your game, is it, you sneaking little innocent?  I'll
bet you're a damn sight wiser than you let on.  But
you don't know this town: you can take that much
from me.  Go to the police!  Go to 'em!  The cops
on this beat are my friends: if you don't believe it,
I'll bring 'em in and introduce you.  They're my
friends, and so's the whole precinct my friends.  Go
to 'em!  Go to 'em, and I'll have you pinched and
locked up for bein' what you are!"
</p>

<p>
Mary had drawn away from the blast, but Rose's
powerful fist caught her under the chin and sent her
crashing down on the bed.
</p>

<p>
"You don't come that on me!" the jailer
continued.  "You've got your choice: you can stay here
and live easy, or walk out and go to jail, and that's
all you can do.  Max ain't comin' back, and you
always knew he wouldn't come back.  You know
what this house is as well as I do, and you've got to
stay here and earn your keep.  If you give one yip
I'll have the cops in!  You don't want to eat, hey?
Well then, you shan't eat!  You can lay there and
starve, or you can knock on the door and get the
best breakfast you ever had, all ready for you.  Do
what you please; but if you let out one yip I'll
hammer the life out of you!"
</p>

<p>
She turned and left the room.  She banged the
door behind her, and Mary, in a swirling dream,
heard herself again locked in her cell.

<br><br>
THE BIRDS OF PREY
</h3>

<p>
Through all the days that immediately
followed&mdash;the days that were nights, and the
nights that were red noondays&mdash;a thousand
horrors, from subtle word to recurring experience,
conjoined to assure to Mary the reality of her
servitude.  All of that first day, after Rose had left her
with the dark blood oozing from her cut chin upon
the scented pillows, she lay, like a wounded dog,
now in a faint and then in a stupor, on the disordered
bed.  As the sunlight shifted and the shadows
lengthened in the room, torpor gave way to reawakened
fear, and she crawled into a corner and tried to hide
herself, trembling, with chattering teeth, at every
sound of laughter that rose from the lower floors,
at every footstep upon the stair.
</p>

<p>
Thrice Rose returned.  Each time she bore a
steaming dish that, as the girl's physical pain grew
less, assailed the nostrils with increasing poignancy.
Each time Mary shook her stubborn russet head.
And each time the visit ended in a beating.
</p>

<p>
Escape by door or window was out of the question;
to attempt to raise an alarm was to invite fresh
violence; and gradually grew the certainty that the
situation was genuinely as the jailer had described
it: that the street was worse than the house, and
that Mary was her own prisoner.  She found the
bottle labeled "Poison," and bit one of the tablets,
but she was young and afraid, and she spat the
burning crumbs from her mouth.  She did not dare to
die, and when Rose came again to the room, her
captive was too weak to refuse the broth that was
fed her, as if she were a sick child, from a spoon.
</p>

<p>
"You're a dear girl, after all," said the mistress,
as she administered the grateful food.  "You do
as I say and you won't never be sorry.  All I want
is to have you sensible.  I'm your friend."
</p>

<p>
Mary said nothing: she was too weak to answer.
</p>

<p>
"And now," Rose pursued, "I'll just give you
a drink."
</p>

<p>
And when she had come back, she had not come
back alone.
</p>

<p>
The worst of prisons is that in which the door
is so cunningly closed upon the inmate that, at last,
after the brutality is familiar, the inmate seems
originally to have closed it upon herself, and in such
a fortress of pain Mary now found herself restrained.
The process was simple.  It was merely first to
wound and then to inure.  The descent to hell is
not easy; it is red with blood and wet with tears;
but hell itself must be endured.
</p>

<p>
It was not for some days that any woman save
Rose came to Mary's cell and then, one afternoon,
two women followed the grating key.
</p>

<p>
They were alike only as to clothes.  Both wore
loose negligé garments, but whereas the one was
sturdy and German-blonde, with straw-colored hair,
round and heavy face, blue eyes and peasant frame&mdash;a
younger Rose&mdash;the other was wiry, compact, her
brows low and dark under somber hair, her full
cheeks red only in defiance of a swarthy skin, her
eyes black and her mouth vermillion.  It was this
one who, with an accent that a more sophisticated
ear than Mary's would have placed along the Seine,
was the first to speak.
</p>

<p>
"'Ello!" she laughed, her teeth gleaming between
her lips like pomegranate seeds.  "We have come to
make the call."
</p>

<p>
Without awaiting a reply, she jumped upon the
bed, drew her feet beneath her, and produced and
lit a cigarette.  The German girl moved more slowly
to the other side and there elaborately ensconced
herself.
</p>

<p>
Mary looked at her visitors without immediately
replying.  She had not, in fact, the remotest idea
of what was the fitting word.
</p>

<p>
But the French girl was unruffled by this silence.
She flung her head back upon a white neck and sent
a slow column of blue smoke curling toward the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
"My name," she explained, with an odd clipping
of her speech, "eet ees Celeste, an' my good frien'
here," she continued with an easy gesture of the
cigarette, "she ees Fritzie&mdash;chust a bar-bar-ous
German."
</p>

<p>
Mary looked at her with a gaze large and listless.
</p>

<p>
"An' you' name?" pursued Celeste, "eet ees&mdash;what?"
</p>

<p>
Fritzie supplied the answer, speaking in a ponderous
contralto.
</p>

<p>
"Her name is Mary," said she.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bien</i>&mdash;a pretty name," Celeste rattled on, precisely
as if her unwilling entertainer had made the
response.  "I like eet well; but"&mdash;and she studied
with unobtrusive care the russet-framed, indignant
face before her&mdash;"eet ees not so good as ees yourself.
I t'ink&mdash;let me see&mdash;yaas: I t'ink I shall call
you 'Violet.'&mdash;Violet, why you don't eat more een
dees 'ouse?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm hardly ever hungry," said Mary.
</p>

<p>
"Not hongry?&mdash;Oh-h, but you mohst be hongry!
Anyone so young mohst want to eat, and anyone so
beautiful mohst eat so as not to loose the
beauty.&mdash;Ees eet not so, Fritzie?"
</p>

<p>
The German girl smiled gently and nodded her
blonde head.
</p>

<p>
"Ach, yes," she rumbled.  "The liebchen!"
</p>

<p>
"No," insisted Mary.  "I don't care about nothing.
I have a headache all the time.  I have one
now."
</p>

<p>
Celeste jumped lightly to the floor: it was as if
to uncoil her feet and to reach the door required but
a single movement.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Un moment!</i>" she laughed.  "I shall feex the
<i>mal de tête</i> immediate!"
</p>

<p>
There was no time for remonstrance; the door
closed upon her concluding word, and Mary was
left there gazing into the stolid, sphinxlike face of
the placidly smiling German.  It was not a bad face,
and soon Mary realized that it was a contented one.
</p>

<p>
Fritzie was returning her look with an equal curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"Are you vorried?" she finally inquired.
</p>

<p>
"No," lied Mary proudly.
</p>

<p>
"I dought you looked like vorried," the German
continued.  "Bud you should be nod.  Dis iss a
goot place.  Dere are loads vorse blaces in New
York dan dis: I know 'em."
</p>

<p>
She paused, but Mary's lips remained closed, her
eyes fixed.
</p>

<p>
"You bed I know 'um!" Fritzie repeated.  "Bud
dis blace&mdash;vhy, ve haf de best meals, so goot nobody
gould besser haf!  I like dis blace."
</p>

<p>
A faint question shot into Mary's face.  At once
Fritzie answered it.
</p>

<p>
"Dat's righd.  Listen: I gome over here two
year ago in de steerage.  Some of de vomen, men
meet dem&mdash;oh, most all de nod-family vons&mdash;un' took
dem to dese here intelligence office dat are only
fakes, un' sold dem, vidout dere knowin' nussin' of
it, fur ten un' fifteen dollar' each.  Bud I vas careful.
I get a real tshob.&mdash;Ach, himmel!"
</p>

<p>
She waved a broad palm in disgust.
</p>

<p>
"Id vas bad enough in de steerage mit all de
sailor-mens kissin' you to-day un' kickin' you
to-morrow; bud dat tshob of mine, dat vas de real limit!
I gome over here because I vouldn't vork in de
fields back home, bud in dat boarding-house vhere
I get dat tshob, I get up at dree o'clock every mornin',
because some of de mens vork in Jefferson Market,
un' I haf to scrub, un' make de beds, un' help cook,
un' vait on dable, un' vash dishes, un' sweep de whole
house oud.  Un' den till late at nighd I haf to help
cook, un' vait on dable, un' vash dishes some more
still.  Vhenever I am sick, or late, or break von dish,
or a boarder don' pay, I gets docked.  Un' almost
every veek I'm sick or late or break a dish or a
boarder don' pay.  My vages is d'ree dollar a veek,
un' I never gets more as two-fifty&mdash;sometime,
two&mdash;un' dat vill nod pay my clothes ad first, un' don'
pay my doctor bills aftervard."
</p>

<p>
The story was told monotonously, without much
show of emotion, but it was enough of itself to wring
a word from the woman to whom it was addressed.
</p>

<p>
"You got sick?" asked Mary.
</p>

<p>
"Who vouldn't?" said Fritzie.  "You bed I get
sick, un' vhen I gome oud of de hospital, de young
doctor&mdash;he'd been makin' grand lofe to me&mdash;he tell
me I vas too nice a girl to vork my hands off fur
nussin' a veek, un' he gif me his visitin' card vith a
writin' on it to a voman he knowed, un' I quit un'
vent dere."
</p>

<p>
She paused, but Mary was silent, and the German
resumed:
</p>

<p>
"It vas a goot place, bud nod so goot as dis von.
I stay a mont' till she move to Philadelphia.  Den
I vent to anozzer house, not so goot as dat first,
fur two mont's till the voman die.  Un' den, after
some more, I gome here, pretty soon, to Miss Rose's.
No"&mdash;she waved her thick hand toward the door
through which Celeste had lately passed&mdash;"I'm nod
like dat Frenchie.  She's vhat Phil Beekman calls
a 'gongenital,' vatever dat iss; I vork hard enough
now, und I vanted to vork righd den; bud I tell you
I could not stand it, dough I vas so strong.  No,
I'm glad I gome here."
</p>

<p>
She leaned back upon her elbow.
</p>

<p>
"Now, dis Celeste&mdash;&mdash;" she began, but the French
girl, just then entering, came with an air that was
a sufficient explanation of her never complex
temperament.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Voilà!</i>" she smiled, holding aloft a long glass
filled by a dull green liquid.  "Let the leetle girl
tak some of thees wheech I meex for her."
</p>

<p>
Before she had well realized what she was doing,
Mary had accepted the glass.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" she asked weakly.
</p>

<p>
"Absinthe," replied Celeste.
</p>

<p>
"It smells like licorice," said Mary.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but no; eet ees not that.  You try thees, an'
then you can eat."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't think I want to eat."
</p>

<p>
"Poof!  That ees folly!  See, now, I meex thees
myself&mdash;I myself have <i>frappé</i> eet.  Ees eet what
you call polite that you say 'no' to me?  Say, now:
ees eet?"
</p>

<p>
Involuntarily Mary smiled.  It was a rueful little
smile, but it was a smile of exhausted consent.
</p>

<p>
"It won't hurt me?"
</p>

<p>
"Thees?  You do not know eet.  Eet ees the
enemy of all the headache, of all the heartache, of
all the bad nerve."
</p>

<p>
For answer Mary drained the glass, and when
her visitors left her they turned no key upon their
exit.
</p>

<p>
So, slowly, through all those early days, and
through the days that immediately followed them,
the spell of the situation worked.  There was
infamy, there was torture.  The unending procession
of visitors&mdash;clerks, drummers, car-conductors, teamsters,
gamesters, thieves, brothers in the fraternity of
lust, equals in the night of horror, mostly drunken,
nearly all unclean of body and everyone filthy of
mind&mdash;the green government note was their certificate
of qualification, the money, however acquired,
constituted their right to those counterfeits which the
house of Rose Légère was maintained to sell.  For
that note, themselves the chattels of conditions, they
might caress or beat; for that, they might take
whatever their hearts demanded.  Was the slave wounded?
Was she ill?  Was she heartbroken?  She must
smile; she must be one woman to all men.  She must
receive the blows with laughter, the ribaldry, the
insults and the curses as wit.  She must pass from
this to that&mdash;and she must not care.
</p>

<p>
And yet Mary, who was Violet now, could do
nothing but take as final the conclusion that Rose
had drawn for her.  To return home, even if she
had the money, would be impossible, because to do
so would be to court her father's anger and her
mother's shame, with no hope of either pardon or
justification.  To go out into the cheerless street that
sent its growling echoes up to her curtained window
would be, she was assured, to deliver herself to
arrest or starvation.  She was ignorant and young.
With no knowledge of the laws and the charities of
the monster town, she saw only that the former, in
uniform, was a back-door friend of her keepers, and
she was told that the latter never helped before they
first publicly burned upon their victims' brows the
thenceforth ineradicable brand of infamy.  Without
there was, at the least, hunger, drudgery and
disgrace; at the most, starvation, jail, death.  Within,
where fresh wounds meant but little, there obtained,
under only a velvet-pawed tyranny, a tolerable
democracy of disrepute, an equality of degradation, where
food, at any rate, and shelter and raiment were
certain, and where old scars and fresh bruises were
hidden from the world: the price was no more than
supine acquiescence.
</p>

<p>
Anything like financial independence was, of
course, impossible: the slaves of Rose Légère were
as much slaves as any mutilated black man of the
Congo, or any toil-cramped white man in a factory.
Their wages were paid to the supervisor, their few
belongings secretly searched for gratuities, and
though one-half of each payment was, theoretically,
the portion of the employé, rent and board and
<i>lingerie</i> demanded, and must needs secure, prices that
left each woman hopelessly in debt to the mistress of
the house.
</p>

<p>
With her senses in revolt, the mind and body of
the newly-christened Violet came, by insidious
degrees, nevertheless to approach some likeness to
adaptability.  Her material wants never went unsupplied,
and such intelligence as she possessed began to swing
toward that point of view to differ from which could
bring nothing save serious discomfort.  To the hope
of Max's return she still, in her own heart, clung
with that tenacity which only a woman can exert upon
an acknowledged impossibility, but she felt even this
hope shrink between her clutching fingers, and, doing
her best to reason, she knew that, even should the
miracle happen, Max had brought her and left her
here with the intent that she should fulfill her
economic destiny.
</p>

<p>
Too dull to see deeply into causes, she could only
accept the slowly numbing hail of effects.  Until a
few days since, she had been a child, and, like most
children, the individual at fault in every personal
catastrophe.  It was thus that she began by blaming
herself for all that had now befallen her; it was
only at moments of growth that she turned her anger
first against her own parents, then against the active
agent and finally against his principal, and it would
be but after deeper vision and harder usage that
she could see both herself and them, and the whole
company that made them possible, as mere grist in
the mill of a merciless machine.
</p>

<p>
And yet for a long time her one passion was the
passion of release.  Without clothes and money and
protection she could understand no escape; but for
these means she at last found courage to appeal to
the one source from which she could conceive of their
coming.

<h3>
VI
<br><br>
AN ANGEL UNAWARES
</h3>

<p>
The man to whom she first spoke, in a stolen
instant, descending the darkened stair, was
a small shopkeeper, fat and pliable, beyond
the age of violence, and, as he had just told her, a
husband and the father of a girl of her own age.
</p>

<p>
"Listen," she said, with one trembling hand upon
his shoulder, "I want you to do me a favor."
</p>

<p>
"Anything you say, Violet," he chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk so loud, then.  I&mdash;I want you to
take me out of here."
</p>

<p>
The man looked at her, through the rosy twilight,
in a flattered bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"Like me as much as that, do you?" he sparred.
</p>

<p>
"You don't understand.  Of course, I like you;
but what I meant was&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He interrupted her, his fat fingers complacently
patting her cheek.
</p>

<p>
"It's not me that don't tumble to the facts," he
said; "it's you.  I told you I was a family man.
I couldn't put you anywhere."
</p>

<p>
"I don't mean that.  I mean&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But again he cut in upon her labored explanation,
his commercial mind traveling along lines in which
it had been forced all his life to travel, and his pride
entrenching itself behind the trivial rampart of his
income.
</p>

<p>
"You girls!" he laughed, in palpable deception.
"You all think I've got a lot of money.  Why, there
ain't no use thinkin' you can bleed me.  I'm a business
man, an' I do everything on a straight business
basis, but I wouldn't rent a flat for the finest of you
that ever walked Fourteenth Street."
</p>

<p>
Violet's answer was brief.  That she should have
given her confidence to such a beast, that such a
beast should continue to thrive in the world that was
closed to her, and that, her pitiable confidence once
given, she should be so grossly misinterpreted&mdash;these
things sent a red rage rushing to her now always
incarnadined cheeks.  She gave the shopkeeper a push
that nearly sent him rolling to the foot of the stairs.
</p>

<p>
"Get away from me!" she whispered hoarsely.
"Get away!  I wouldn't have you for a gift!"
</p>

<p>
The man stumbled and gripped the rose-colored
lamp upon the newel-post, which swayed, under his
rocking weight, like a palm-tree in a storm.  He
gasped for breath, got it, and, shaking his fist
upward through the shadows, began to bellow forth
a storm of oaths that, for foulness, utterly outdid
the ejaculations to which, from both sexes, Violet
was already becoming accustomed.
</p>

<p>
"You come down here," he courageously shouted,
"and I'll give you the worst beating you ever had
in your life!  Nice place, this is!  I'll have it
pinched&mdash;you see if I don't!  You can't make an easy thing
out o' me!  You've robbed me, anyhow.  You'll get
what's comin' to you!"&mdash;And he ended with the
single epithet to which those four walls were
unaccustomed.
</p>

<p>
Rose ran out from the parlor.
</p>

<p>
"Shut up, you!" she commanded of the disturber,
in a low tone that nevertheless compelled obedience.
"What's the trouble, Violet?"
</p>

<p>
Violet leaned against the stair-wall, half-way up,
her burning hands pressed to her burning face.  She
was mad with anger and shame, but she was also
afraid.
</p>

<p>
"You heard him," she gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," snapped the visitor, his voice uncontrollably
resuming its former timbre, "and you
heard me, too!"
</p>

<p>
The mistress is, of necessity, always, in a crisis,
against the slave.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Rose, "tell me what she done."
</p>

<p>
Violet, however, saw at once the necessity of changing
the issue.
</p>

<p>
"He says he's been robbed!" she called down the
stairs.  And then she ran after her words, and stood
under the lamp, facing them both, her arms extended,
the flowing sleeves trembling with the emotion that
they covered but could not conceal.  "Search me!"
she commanded.  "If you think I took a cent of
yours, search me!"
</p>

<p>
She was a vision that brought conviction with it.
</p>

<p>
Before the sputtering visitor could correct the
situation, Rose had, perhaps against her will, been
converted.  She took the man's hat from the hall-rack
at her side, put it on his head, opened the
street-door, and gently propelled him through it.
</p>

<p>
"You're drunk," she said, "an' you'd better
get out before I call the cop.  There ain't no
badger business in this house, an' don't you
forget it!"
</p>

<p>
She shut the door, and turned calmly to Violet.
</p>

<p>
"How much did you get?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Miss Rose, you know&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I mean what did you touch him for?  You
mustn't play that sort of game here: it gives the
house a bad name.  But just this once we'll divide
up an' not say anything more about it."
</p>

<p>
Violet's eyes opened wide.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't steal a penny," she declared.
</p>

<p>
Rose regarded her with a softening countenance.
</p>

<p>
"Word of honor?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Word of honor," vowed Violet.
</p>

<p>
"All right, but even if you do touch them, you
mustn't ever let them <i>think</i> you do.  A man'll forgive
you for hurtin' him anywhere but in his
pocket-book.&mdash;You're all worked up, dearie.  Come on out
to the kitchen an' have a bottle of beer."
</p>

<p>
As they were pouring the drinks, a heavy foot
sounded in the outside passageway and a careful four
knocks followed upon the rear door.
</p>

<p>
"That's Larry," said Rose, and drew the bolt.
</p>

<p>
A policeman's hat was poked through the doorway,
followed by a flushed, genial Irish face, and a
tall, hulking body in regulation uniform.
</p>

<p>
"I'm terrible dry," grinned Larry.
</p>

<p>
"Then you've come to the right shop," was Rose's
greeting.  "We're just havin' a little drop ourselves.
Larry, this is my new friend, Violet."
</p>

<p>
The policeman grinned again, and sat carefully
upon the edge of a kitchen-chair, in evident fear that
his bulk might prove too great for it.
</p>

<p>
"Glad to know you," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Larry's on this beat nights," Rose explained to
Violet, "an' him an' the lieutenant look after
us&mdash;don't you, Riley?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, what use is a frind if he don't take care
of yez, Miss Rose?  We do the bist we can."
</p>

<p>
"I know that.&mdash;What'll it be, Larry?  We're
takin' beer, but there's wine on the ice if you want
it."
</p>

<p>
"I'll just have a small drap of liquor, ma'am,
please," said Riley.
</p>

<p>
Rose poured and handed to him a glass of whiskey.
</p>

<p>
"When you came by," she inquired, "did you see
a fat man throwin' fits in our gutter?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, I did not.  Have ye been afther havin' a
rumpus the night?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no&mdash;only that fat little fellow that keeps
the jewelry-store around the corner.  He was drunk,
an' I threw him out.  If he tries to get gay, let me
know, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I'll let ye know&mdash;an' here's to your
very good health, ma'am an' miss.&mdash;But you may
rist aisy; that there won't be no throuble."
</p>

<p>
"I know that: he's too scared of his wife.&mdash;Have
another, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
The officer rose.
</p>

<p>
"No, thank ye kindly," he said.  "I wanted but
the drap, ma'am."
</p>

<p>
"And how are Mrs. Riley and the children?"
</p>

<p>
Larry's face became a web of smiling wrinkles.
</p>

<p>
"Grand," he said; "the auld woman's grand&mdash;you
ought to see her in the new silk dress I bought
'er the day&mdash;all grane wid fancy trimmin's from
Six' Avenoo.  An' the kiddies is thrivin'.  Cecilia'll
soon be havin' to go to work an' help the family
funds, she's that sthrong and hearty, an' young Van
Wyck is such a divil that the teacher throwed him
out of school.  He's licked all the b'ys in his class,
an' I think he'll end as a champeen pug."
</p>

<p>
He went out, still smiling, and, as he did so, Violet
saw Rose, after stooping hurriedly, place in his hands
a yellow bill.  As the door closed, there came into
the younger woman's eyes the question that she would
not have dared to ask.
</p>

<p>
"Yep," nodded Rose, "that's my week's pay for
what they call protection."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't he afraid to take it?" Violet, thus
encouraged, inquired.
</p>

<p>
"The man above him isn't afraid to take two-thirds
of it," said Rose, "an' the best of it goes past
him to the district boss&mdash;it's the regular system with
the regular prices.  Oh, no, he ain't afraid; an' if
you ever tried to live on a copper's pay, you'd soon
be afraid not to take it."
</p>

<p>
Violet, returning to the parlor, bit her lip: there
was indeed small help to be had from the law.
</p>

<p>
Small help, either there or elsewhere.  She turned,
naturally, only to the seemingly more prosperous
customers, but, even by them, she was met with smiling
incredulity: her story was so hackneyed that it could
not be true.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right enough to want to get out of here,"
said her sagest adviser, who at least paid her the rare
compliment of credence; "but how are you going to
live after you get out?  You can't go home; you
haven't got any trade; you can't cook; without a
recommendation you can't get even a job at general
housework or in a factory."
</p>

<p>
He was a quiet, middle-aged widower that said
this, an infrequent visitor, a chief clerk in one of
the departments of a large insurance company, with
a reputation for liberal kindliness at Rose's and, in
his own little world, a position of some influence.
</p>

<p>
"You get me out," said Violet, "an' I'll do the rest."
</p>

<p>
But here again the gate was barred against her.
The clerk was burdened with a good name and a
place of trust.  He could risk neither the one nor
the other.  He was sorry, genuinely sorry&mdash;she saw
that; but what could he do?
</p>

<p>
It was an evening or two later that she found her
first pale ray of encouragement, and she found it in
the person of Philip Beekman, that same young Beekman
to whom Fritzie had casually referred.
</p>

<p>
Beekman described himself, with some accuracy,
as a person of good family and bad morals.  "We
are getting so confounded poor," he used to say,
"that I sometimes doubt the former; but I have
constant visible evidence of the latter, and so I cling
to that as the one sure thing in this uncertain life."  Had
he but seen the facts, he might well have considered
his derelictions as the result of his parentage.
At her divorce, his mother had been awarded the
custody of her only child, and, now that she had
remarried, Philip was forced to play that neither
uncommon nor congenial rôle&mdash;the part of the young
man with too little training to earn a living and too
much ancestry to marry one.
</p>

<p>
"After all," he said, as he sat with Violet in the
many-colored back parlor, a half-empty bottle
between them, his usually pale face aglow, his gray
eyes filmy, and his black hair tumbled by the constant
passage through it of his long, nervous fingers&mdash;"after
all, you see, you and I are in the same boat.
You can't get out because, if you do, the sharks will
eat you, and I daren't get out because I can't
swim."
</p>

<p>
Always haunted by the fear that, in some manner,
her true story might reach her own town and her
own people, Violet had told him only as much as she
dared, and what she had said had moved his
impulsive generosity.
</p>

<p>
"But anyway," he insisted, "you can do one thing
that I can't."
</p>

<p>
She clutched at the straw.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"You can get help from shore."
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean that if you'll write a letter home, I'll
mail it."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head: the straw crumpled in her
fingers.
</p>

<p>
"There's no use of that," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Of course there is.  After all, your father's your
father, you see, and I don't know a father that
wouldn't help his daughter out of the sort of mess
you've got into."
</p>

<p>
"I know one," said Violet, grimly.
</p>

<p>
"Not till you try him, you don't."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do.  If you was in my place would your
father&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Which father?" laughed Beekman.  "My one
won't have anything to do with me because I live with
the other, and the other won't have anything to do
with me because I'm the son of his predecessor.&mdash;You
take my advice and write home."
</p>

<p>
"I'd never get an answer."
</p>

<p>
She spoke in an even tone, but there was no
mistaking the tragedy that underlay it.
</p>

<p>
Beekman looked at her and blinked queerly.  He
brought his fist down smartly among the jangling
glasses.
</p>

<p>
"It's a rotten shame!" he said.  "A dirty, rotten
shame!  Why, don't you know that that yid who
got you into this makes a business of such things?
Don't you know there's a whole army of them that
do?  I wish to the Lord I could do something, but
there isn't a policeman or a magistrate in the city
who'd listen to me&mdash;they know too well where they
get the jam for their bread and butter&mdash;and I can't
get a job for even myself, let alone you!"
</p>

<p>
She had not, however, heard his last sentence.
Her blue eyes wide, she was hanging on his reference
to Max.
</p>

<p>
"A business?" she repeated.  "Do you mean that
men make money&mdash;that way?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do."  The film passed suddenly from
Beekman's eyes, leaving them alert with purpose.
"Look here," he said, "there is one thing I can do,
and I don't know anything that I'd enjoy more: you
give me that little kyke's name, and I'll push his
face out of the back of his head!"
</p>

<p>
Then there happened a strange thing.  She had
long guessed and now she knew, but guessing or
knowing, she would not believe.  As much for her
own sanity as for Max's safety, she lied.
</p>

<p>
"The name he gave me," she said, "wasn't his
right one.  It wasn't even one he mostly used.  And
I never knew no other."
</p>

<p>
Beekman raised his hands in more than mock
despair, and got up to go.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he declared, "I don't know what I can
do for you.  If I got into any scandal, it would punch
the last hole in my meal-ticket."
</p>

<p>
Violet, who was becoming accustomed to such
replies, smiled kindly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want you to get into no trouble for me,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
"I know you don't, and I couldn't be any use if
I did.  But I'll promise you this: I'll keep my eyes
open, and if anything does turn up, I'll be
Johnny-on-the-spot, all right."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Violet.
</p>

<p>
"And look here," pursued Beekman, "I know
that it's all rot to expect you to walk out of here
without friends or a job; I know that, unless you've got
one or the other, you're just simply in jail here; but
if I can't get you anything, there must be those who
can.  Why don't you talk to the coal-men, or the
gas-inspectors, or&mdash;I tell you, I've seen that
tow-headed Dutchman who leaves the beer here.  He
looks straight, and he stops at the door.  Why don't
you talk to him?  He's the sort that would know
of a job for&mdash;for&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Beekman hesitated, blushing like a schoolboy.
</p>

<p>
"For my sort?" asked Violet.  "Maybe he is.
Thank you.  Anyhow I'll see."
</p>

<p>
And she did see.  When Beekman left her, pressing
into her hand the last piece of money that he
would have for a week, he gave her at the same time
so much of hope.  Those who seemed rich could not
help her; she would appeal to those who were poor.
</p>

<p>
She was up early and in the kitchen the next
morning at the hour when she knew the brewery-wagon
would stop outside, and she sent the ebon Cassie on
an errand to the corner pharmacy.  The maid had
scarcely closed the door before Violet was summoned
to open it to the German of whom Beekman had
spoken.
</p>

<p>
Philip had observed well.  The brewery's driver,
who stood whistling in the areaway, was a short,
stocky man with the neck and arms of a gladiator
and the round, smiling face of a child.  His blue
overalls and dark cloth cap accentuated the fairness
of his hair, and his round inquiring eyes were alive
with continual good-humor.  He had just piled a
half-dozen cases of beer beside the doorway.
</p>

<p>
Violet, in her crimson kimona, took from the table
the money that had been left for him.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning," she said as she handed him the bills.
</p>

<p>
He accepted the money with his left hand and,
with his right, raised his cap from his clustering
curls.  His lips ceased whistling, half regretfully.
</p>

<p>
"Goot-mornin'," he replied, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Won't you come in and have a drink?" asked
Violet, adopting Rose's form of salutation.
</p>

<p>
"No, t'ank you," the German shook his head.  "I
neffer trinks nussing bud beer."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Violet, "we have lots of that now."
</p>

<p>
"Und I neffer trink dot till tinner."
</p>

<p>
There was an awkward pause.  The German, not
knowing how to leave without seeming rudeness, was
shifting his weight from one heavily shod foot to
the other.  The woman, uncertain how to say the
words she wanted to say, remained with her hand
upon the knob.
</p>

<p>
"You don't?" she awkwardly repeated.
</p>

<p>
"No, und so I t'ink&mdash;I t'ink I besser be goin',"
he hurriedly concluded, and began to turn on his
heel.
</p>

<p>
The necessity for quick action roused her.
</p>

<p>
"Wait," she said.  And then, as he faced her
again in mute wonder, she pressed another bill into
his hand.  "I want you to help me," she continued.
"I want to get a job somewhere, and I don't want
Miss Rose to know nothing about it."
</p>

<p>
He looked from the bill to her, still wondering.
</p>

<p>
"So-o?" he responded.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I want work&mdash;some other kind of work&mdash;and
I thought perhaps you might"&mdash;her voice
faltered&mdash;"might know of some kind."
</p>

<p>
The German's mobile face underwent a quick
change.  First astonishment and then something not
far removed from tears came into his childlike eyes.
He crushed the bill in his big red fist.
</p>

<p>
"So-o?" he repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I&mdash;you understand that I must have friends
or a job if I am to get away from here, and I thought
you might know of something."
</p>

<p>
The German bobbed his curls.
</p>

<p>
"I know dot right vell," he said; "bud I don'
know no tshob chust now."
</p>

<p>
Violet's face darkened.
</p>

<p>
"All right," she answered, "I only hoped maybe&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Look here, miss," the driver cut in with a note
of ready feeling in his voice.  "You mean all dot?"
</p>

<p>
"All what?"
</p>

<p>
"About geddin' ozzer&mdash;aboud a real tshob."
</p>

<p>
"If I had the clothes and a place I'd go this
minute."
</p>

<p>
"Vell, den, listen.  I've chust god a new blace;
I'm goin' to be bar-tender ofer on Segond Avenue,
bud I gan send back here if I hear anysing.&mdash;Your
name?"
</p>

<p>
"Violet&mdash;just Miss Violet."
</p>

<p>
"All righd, Miss Violet, I know some more aboud
dese blaces like dis dan you maybe t'ink, und I guess
maybe I gan do somesing.  Nex' Sunday I dake my
girl to Coney, und den ve'll dalk sings ofer und ve'll
see vhat Katie says."
</p>

<p>
In spite of the promised delay and the growing
habit of doubt, Violet's face kindled.
</p>

<p>
"You're good," she said simply, "and I'll trust you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I make nussing," replied the German, smiling
once more, "bud chust you vait: Katie gan fix
it; she gan fix anysing."
</p>

<p>
Before Violet could reply, he had resumed his
whistling and run down the alleyway; and she saw
that he had tossed back her money on the topmost
beercase.
</p>

<h3>
VII
<br><br>
HOLIDAY
</h3>

<p>
That Sunday morning in his single, dark,
narrow room, Hermann Hoffmann, the erstwhile
driver of a brewery-wagon and the coming
Second Avenue barkeeper, arose with the dawn, just
as if it had been a workday morning, and set about
his elaborate toilet, whistling.
</p>

<p>
To the casual eye there would have seemed little in
his surroundings to inspire any lyric joy.  The
cell-like apartment, which was the only spot on earth
that Hermann might call his home, was a back room
on the top floor of a damp and gloomy tenement
in a filthy court running off Houston Street near
Avenue A.  Only at noon did the pale sunlight strain
into that court, crowded all morning with malarious
dogs and dirty, toddling babies solemnly, but vainly,
trying to learn how to play, and echoing all through
the black night now to the curses of scarred, slinking
tiger-cats, now to the staggering footsteps or the
brawling oaths of drunkards reeling homeward
through the evil-smelling darkness, and again to the
piercing cry of a woman in mortal agony or mortal
fear.
</p>

<p>
Robbins's Row was no place for a policeman after
nightfall, and scarcely a safer place for a stranger
by day.  From its sagging file of dirty, paper-patched
windows, more or less feminine shapes leaned out,
calling gossip to their neighbors, and hauling at the
pullied ropes that, crossing the street, spread above
the pedestrians a tossing, parti-colored canopy of
"wash."  You entered it by climbing three rotting
wooden steps, by stumbling through a wet hall, where
a blue-burning gas-jet accentuated the sense of
perpetual midnight, and you could reach the room of
Hermann Hoffmann only by a perilous climb of six
flights of stairs.
</p>

<p>
That room was as bare as any in the building.  It
looked out, by a single slit in the wall, upon a
light-shaft, strangely misnamed.  Its only furniture was a
cot, a wooden-seated chair, a washstand, and, bearing
comb and brushes and shaving-utensils, one of those
pine bureaus the drawers of which may be opened
in ten minutes, and closed, if you are lucky, in fifteen.
Yet the note of the place was the note of order and
of neatness; the bare floor was clean, and, against the
fresh and brightly papered wall, there hung here a
calico curtain that hid the tenant's wardrobe and there
a single shelf bearing only, as if it were an altar
consecrated to one holy object, a thumbed and
dog's-eared copy of "Das Kapital."
</p>

<p>
Hermann plunged his ruddy face, whistling, into a
bowl of water and drew it out, more ruddy and
whistling still.  Even the author of that portentous
volume on the book-shelf used to sing "Strausbourg,"
and Hermann's single anthem was "Die Wacht Am
Rhein."
</p>

<p>
Still pursuing that inspiring music, he turned to the
bureau and began to shave the yellow down from
his cheeks and chin.  Thrust between the exaggerating
mirror and its frame were two photographs&mdash;the
one, a trifle faded, of a matronly, kindly woman
of his own race, perhaps fifty years old, stiffly arrayed
in a silk dress rigorously American, and the other,
a new one, that of a young girl in a great hat and
unmistakably Manhattan dress, a young girl with
a pretty, piquant face of that distinctively American
type&mdash;the Irish.  Perhaps these photographs
distracted the German's attention; perhaps it was only
that no man living can successfully whistle and shave
at one and the same time.  At any rate, his hand
shook, and the razor cut a light gash in his upper
lip.
</p>

<p>
He flung the offending blade from him, and it
struck the mirror, cracking the glass across one
corner.
</p>

<p>
"Ach, Gott," he smiled, as he staunched the blood
with a heavy pressure through a rough towel; and
then, in the English that he used even in his
soliloquies: "Dey say now dot means bad luck fer seven
year.  Lucky is't dot I am not suberstitious!"
</p>

<p>
And then, undisturbed, he quietly resumed his
whistling, finished shaving, sleeked down his
rebellious tow-colored curls, got into a newly pressed
brown suit and yellow shirt, donned a high collar
and salmon tie, and, setting a carefully brushed derby
upon his head, descended to the narrow street, the
strains of "Die Wacht Am Rhein" lingering behind
him through the darkened hallway.
</p>

<p>
To accomplish the purpose of his early rising, he
took the Third Avenue elevated to the Forty-second
Street station.  There he bought two bouquets of
carnations&mdash;one pink and the other white&mdash;and
boarded a suburban train, which bore him, at last,
to one of those little stations that New York, which
has so small time for remembrance, has selected for
the hiding of its dead.
</p>

<p>
In the warm sunlight of the spring morning, Hermann
picked his certain way among the green grass
and the white-roofed habitations of the sleepers, until
he came upon a little plot, by no means the cheapest
or more obscure in the burying-ground, and there,
his lips still pursed, but silent now, took off his
shining derby and paused before the solitary white stone.
With much that was unaffectedly reverent, he knelt,
according to his weekly custom, and placed the white
carnations on the grave, and with a great deal that
was just as unaffectedly proud, he read, also according
to that custom, the inscription cut upon the white
stone that he had purchased with what, when he
paid the bill, happened to be his last dollar:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  Here In Peace<br>
  Lies The Body Of<br>
  WlLHELMINA HOFFMANN,<br>
  Widow Of Ludwig Hoffmann,<br>
  Of Andernach, Rhenish Prussia,<br>
  Who Dep't'd This Life, Jan. 10, 1907.<br>
  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br>
  "<i>Wait thou, wait thou; soon thou shall rest also.</i>"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The inscription was in English, but when he had
finished reading it, the dead woman's son said, under
his breath, the Lord's Prayer in the language of
Luther, as she had taught it him.
</p>

<p>
"She liked me to pray," he shamefacedly explained
to the circumambient atmosphere, as if prayer
in any tongue were a compromise with his principles.
"Und vhile I'm aboud it, I mighd as vell use de
old langwage.  If the Herr Gott listens at all, He'd
hear it some besser in de vay She said it."
</p>

<p>
And then he resumed his hat and his anthem, and
returned to town.
</p>

<p>
Katie Flanagan was waiting for him as he came
hurrying up the steps from the subway at Park
Place&mdash;the piquant, pretty girl of the photograph,
in black, because her parents had died not long since,
but in black just as elaborate as her slender purse
would permit, because she knew the full value of her
raven hair and blossoming cheeks and tender eyes of
Irish blue.
</p>

<p>
"Ach," gasped Hermann, "hof I kep' you a long
time vaitin'?"
</p>

<p>
"Only about as long as you mostly do," she
answered.  Her voice was like her eyes, and she spoke
with but the charming hint of a Galway brogue.
</p>

<p>
The German's cheeks burned with humiliation.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," he apologized.  "I god up early to
be on dime, bud de train vas lade from the cem't'ry
in."
</p>

<p>
She understood and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"It's only five minutes I've been here," she confessed.
</p>

<p>
"Und I brought you a few bosies, Katie.  I
d'ought maybe&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she seized the carnations with a laugh
of delight, and buried her nose in them.  "It's good
y'are to think of such things, Hermann&mdash;and a bad
lad that y'are to spend the money so!"
</p>

<p>
They were making their way toward the Bridge,
the sturdy Hoffmann shouldering a passage through
the momentarily swelling Sunday morning crowd.
</p>

<p>
"Dot liddle makes nussing," he proudly
protested.  "To-morrow I begin ad my new tshob."
</p>

<p>
"But that," said Katie, "won't pay you hardly
wan dollar a week more'n the brewery did.  I dunno,
but I think&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
There, however, her protest, for the moment,
ended.  They were caught, clinging together, in the
whirlpool of the entrance; carried nearly off their
feet, rushed by the ticket-window with a quick
exchange of small coin, and, a few minutes later, were
battling their way among the press into a waiting
Coney Island train.
</p>

<p>
In the last charge, Hermann, his lips puckered in
the battle-hymn, did heroic service.  While Katie
hung tightly to one arm, he used manfully the elbow
of the other; pushed a guard to the right; shoved
two cigarette-smoking youths to the left; wriggled
through the already crowded platform and shot into
one of the coveted "cross-seats."  Much of the park
would not be open for a month or more to come,
but New York was already clamoring for its playground.
</p>

<p>
Katie, flushed and triumphant, sank beside him,
and busied herself with the task of straightening her
big black hat.  Hermann watched her in frank
admiration as she sat there, her arms raised to her
head, in that pose which, of all others, is the most
becoming to her sex.
</p>

<p>
"What are you lookin' at?" she archly wondered,
casting a smiling, sidelong, blue glance at him.
</p>

<p>
But before her the strong man was a timid child.
</p>

<p>
"Ad de brettiest bicture in a whole vorld," he
stammered.
</p>

<p>
Katie laughed again.
</p>

<p>
"Och," she said in gratified disapproval, "there
sure must be a Castle Blarney somewhere on the
Rhine.  What favor are you wantin' to ask me now,
I wonder."
</p>

<p>
Once he had started, Hermann was too dogged
thus to be retarded.
</p>

<p>
"It's chust de same old fafor," he pleaded, as,
with a great creaking of brakes, the train began to
swing upon the Bridge.  "Now I god my new tshob,
Katie, there gan't for nod hafin' our veddin' be no
good reason, gan dere?"
</p>

<p>
"There's one," she said, still delighting in her
coquetry; "there's one reason."
</p>

<p>
"Vat is 't?"
</p>

<p>
"Its name is Father Kelly."
</p>

<p>
"Katie, you von't led dot gount!"
</p>

<p>
"I will so."
</p>

<p>
"Und I haf to gome into your church, und&mdash;und
all dem d'ings?"
</p>

<p>
"You do that."
</p>

<p>
Hermann squirmed; but he knew of old that from
this point she was neither to be persuaded nor driven.
It was a discussion that they had held many a time
before, and every time she would give him no
answer to his suit until he should surrender in
this particular.  Now, however, he considered
himself about to set foot upon the highroad to
prosperity, and the prosperous can ill afford to skimp
magnanimity.
</p>

<p>
"<i>All</i> righd," he at last somewhat ruefully conceded,
though with certain mental reservations into
which it seemed then unnecessary to enter: "I'm a
strong von, und hof stood a lot a'ready, so I t'ink
I gan stand dot too.  I'll do it."
</p>

<p>
He took her by surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Promise?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Sure I bromise."
</p>

<p>
"No backin' out whatever happens?"
</p>

<p>
"No packin' oud."
</p>

<p>
"Well, God bless you then."
</p>

<p>
There was a catch in her voice as she said it.
Into her lonely, hardworking life, this strong,
soft-hearted, poor and cheerful German had brought
about all the sunshine that she had latterly known,
and she could think of nothing better than to give
him the answer that he was so honestly anxious to
hear.  But, though he had become more and more
to her from the first evening when he had seized her
as she was falling from the platform of a surface-car
that had started too quickly on its way, she had
seen enough of the warfare with poverty in her own
family to resolve that she would not marry until she
could contribute her share to the wages of the
resulting household, and now she had neither a position
nor the immediate likelihood of obtaining one.  It
was hard, but she was used to hardship, and so,
because she must not cry, she smiled.
</p>

<p>
Hermann tried to grasp her hand, but she easily
eluded him.
</p>

<p>
"Den, vhen do ve say?" he eagerly demanded.
</p>

<p>
Much as it hurt her to hurt him, she laughed her
answer:
</p>

<p>
"As soon as I get me fingers on a job that'll pay
me six dollars a week, we'll have Father Kelly say
the words for us."
</p>

<p>
"But Katie"&mdash;he used to say "Gatie" until she
had teased him out of it&mdash;"you don' mean dot!
You said&mdash;you dold me&mdash;you bromise&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He floundered in the breakers of amazement.  She
turned her face away, and looked out of the window
at the gigantic mockery of Liberty in the harbor;
but she could not find it in her heart long to remain
silent.  She faced him once more.
</p>

<p>
"It's no use, Hermann," she said, her eyes very
big and serious.  "Here y'are goin' to Schleger's
place with your first good chance at a way as'll lead
you to somethin' worth workin' for&mdash;you said yourself
it might end in a café o' your own&mdash;an' to get
there you'll be needin' every blessed cent you can
save.  Do you think now I could look at meself in
the glass mornin's if I married you an' kep' you
down?  No, thank God, I'm not so bad as that."
</p>

<p>
He sputtered toward a protest, but she waved him
down.
</p>

<p>
"Now don't be tellin' me that two can live as
cheap as one," she said.  "I seen that pleasant lie
nailed this many a year, an' I know more about
housekeepin' in five minutes than you can learn in a
lifetime.  Things was plenty bad five years past, an'
now they're worse yet.  What rent is you know, an'
what clothes is you can't even guess.  Here's
beefsteak at twenty-two cents the pound; veal up to
thirty an' still goin' up.  The papers make a fuss
an' get the prices down three cents for three days,
an' then the dealers put them up again when none's
lookin'.  An' as for eggs, you can pay seventy-five
cents a dozen for them, winters, with the hour an'
minute of the layin' stamped on them, if you're a
millionaire, or you can get nine for a quarter if you
hold your nose."
</p>

<p>
The hopeful Hermann shook his blonde head.
</p>

<p>
"But Katie," he said, "I don' gare if I neffer
ged a gafé off my own.  I don' vant a gafé: I vant
you."
</p>

<p>
She smiled again.
</p>

<p>
"You flatter me by the choice," she said; "but if
we can get along without the drink, we can't get
along without a bite to eat now an' then.  No,
Hermann-boy, it's no use, I'm tellin' you.  I seen
it tried.  Me father swang a pick and me mother
took in washin'&mdash;when she could get it&mdash;an' even
then it wouldn't work: the one would have starved
to death if the third rail hadn't got him, an' poor
mother killed herself tryin' to keep her an' me.  It
won't work, an' I know it."
</p>

<p>
While the train hurried above the dead level of
Brooklyn houses, out through the suburban monstrosities
and across the dunes, the optimist, still an
optimist, renewed his endeavors to find the chance
for lodging his own arguments; but all the while
Katie continued to overwhelm him with a flow of
errors.  They had almost reached the sandy island
before Hermann, still stubbornly hopeful, elected to
drop the subject for the present, and took up, in its
stead, the story of Violet.
</p>

<p>
He spoke simply, which is to say forcibly, and he
had an understanding, and therefore sympathetic,
audience.  Katie's face immediately softened.
</p>

<p>
"The poor child!" she murmured.  "An' don't
I know what it is?  I've seen them go under, here
one an' there another, hungry or overworked, every
mother's daughter of them.  There was Molly Ryan,
as good a girl as you'd find in a day's search of the
parish, left alone with no one to put clothes on her
back; an' pretty Agnes Donovan&mdash;out of work for
four months&mdash;her as died in the City Hospital; an'
Giulia Fortuni, whose father kept a fruit-stand by
the Grand Street "L" station.&mdash;What can we do
for her, Hermann-boy?"
</p>

<p>
"Dot's vat I vanted to ask you, Katie," said Hoffmann.
"She has to hof friends und vork first of all."
</p>

<p>
"Friends she has right here; but work she must
have whether or no.  I begin me old search for meself
in the mornin', an' I'll keep eye an' mouth ready
to get a job for her."
</p>

<p>
Cynically hopeless and city-wise in regard to her
own chances, Katie's Celtic soul warmed to something
of Hermann's optimism in the cause of a sister.
She began planning at once, and when the train
drew up outside the tunnel-shed, she had the absent
Violet established as a cloak-model in the big Lennox
Department-Store, and engaged to marry a floor-walker.
</p>

<p>
And then Coney&mdash;Coney the sweetly reasonable in
price and the extravagantly generous in provision&mdash;crowded
out of her mind, for that day, all thoughts
save the thought of itself.
</p>

<p>
A great many years ago&mdash;oh, a very great many
years ago!&mdash;when you were a little boy, your father
took you to the county-fair.  You remember it, even
yet, as a purple day in the glad calendar of your
childhood: the blood cattle, the show of farm
implements, the prize pumpkins, the side-shows with
their fat ladies and skeleton gentlemen, and the suave
individual that put a bean under a cup and then,
for a dollar, showed your shrewd parent that it
was under another.  But above all you remember the
crowd.  Never before had you seen so many people
in one place, never realized that there were so many
people in the world; and even now, out of the past,
you can hear an awed voice saying:
</p>

<p>
"There are five thousand persons here."
</p>

<p>
Well, back home, the county-fair, thank heaven,
continues to grow.  Cattle are sleeker and pumpkins
larger; the fat ladies weigh more and the thin gentlemen
less; the shell-game, in one form or another,
aids the progress of agriculture by making five
dollars grow where only one grew before.  But, in the
meantime, the ugly, delightful "amusement-park"
has brought the county-fair to the city-limit, and
nearly three hundred thousand persons go to Coney
Island every day.
</p>

<p>
Early in the season though they were, Katie and
Hermann no sooner stepped upon that Surf Avenue
which is at once the heart and the aorta of the Island,
than they felt, as there they always felt, that they
had entered upon the Land of Carnival.  The broad,
but crowded, way was dancing with the noise of
festival, with the clangor of brass bands, the cries
of venders, the smell of the circus, the tang of the
sea.
</p>

<p>
Here, from mixed drinks to mixed music, went not
the thugs and blacklegs, the pallid men and the
painted women that would have filled such a place
had it been within the borough of Manhattan.  In
their stead here drove the cars of generally stolid
people of business and leisure, and here, above all,
walked the workers of the city, the weaker sex and
the stronger, seeking holiday.  The full-portion hat
on the half-portion girl is as familiar to Surf Avenue
as to the Waldorf palm-room; care is erased from
the tablets of memory.  On Coney there is no To-morrow.
</p>

<p>
The laughter of the hundreds of children rang
out no more freely than did that of the thousands
of their elders.  Mothers with babies in their arms
were young again.  Stately blondes and languorous
brunettes, gracefully seated on the wooden steeds of
the score of merry-go-rounds, rode with a dignity
unsurpassed in Hyde Park or the Bois, and never
a cowboy at a round-up was more adventurous than
the young East-Sider mounting a hired horse upon
the Pony Track.
</p>

<p>
Every nook had something to sell, and Katie had
her day's work in keeping Hermann from stopping
at each booth.  There were miles of scenic railways
on all of which he wished to ride; there were scores
of panorama that tempted him with pictures of every
disaster from the San Francisco fire to the Messina
earthquake.  There were the familiar canes waiting
to be caught with the familiar ring: there were the
familiar chutes to be shot, and the familiar "galleries"
where the rattle of rifles recalled the battle
of the Yalu.  Down on the beach an army was shouting
in the surf, and on every hand along the jostling,
good-natured street were peanuts and popcorn,
"crispettes" and "hot dogs."  Upon dozens of
polished floors dancers were slowly revolving with a
marvelous ability to distinguish between the time of
their own orchestra and that of the band in the café
opposite, and everywhere were picture machines and
machines that sang.
</p>

<p>
Cheap it doubtless was, but cheap also in the sense
of small cost.  Except in the larger cafés, the ordinary
drinks sold at only five cents the glass, and the
glasses were not an insult to the drinkers' capacity.
Hermann and Katie had their beer at one of the
smaller places.  They dined for twenty-five cents
apiece, without tips, at the "Home-Made-Lunch-Room";
they were twirled and buffeted in a swiftly
revolving car down a series of precipitous canvas
chasms, paying five cents apiece for the privilege of
the shaking-up that, at home, Hermann would have
resented with a blow; and they chose the last seat in
the last car of a steep gravity railway, where a man
must hold himself aboard with one arm and his
shrieking sweetheart aboard with the other.
</p>

<p>
It was all blatant, all tawdry, all the apotheosis
of the ridiculous, all essentially America-at-play; but
when, at night, in the electric-train shooting through
the warm darkness, the pair returned citywards, it
was toward their own hard-earned and with difficulty
retained places of shelter that they were going, like
children after a strenuous holiday of make-believe
with school to begin upon the morrow; and if, in
most of the seats, as in that occupied by Katie and
Hermann, girls slept with their heads resting frankly
upon sleeping masculine shoulders, it was but a rest
before conventional partings at home-doorways, the
play-day ended for the lonely couch, and the
work-day soon to begin.

<h3>
VIII
<br><br>
MR. WESLEY DYKER
</h3>

<p>
In that company of the ignoble army of martyrs
over which circumstances had given Rose Légère
command, there were five members.  Besides
Mary, who now was Violet, Celeste, whom ancient
conditions had temperamentally predetermined for
such service, and Fritzie, who had chosen a partly
moral slavery as less onerous than a wholly economic
servitude, there was the highly colored Englishwoman
Evelyn, who regarded her present station as one of
the descending steps inevitable for everyone that set
foot upon the way they all were treading, and
Wanda, a dark little Russian Jewess, who, as soon
as she had landed at the South Ferry from Ellis
Island, had fallen into the hands of the slave-traders,
and had thenceforward persistently striven upward to
the place she now inhabited.
</p>

<p>
For the maintenance of her authority upon these
and their patrons, Rose, unlike some of her fellows,
did not have to depend upon the assistance of any
man quartered in the house.  To the discipline of the
inmates her system of charge for clothes, food, and
shelter was admirably suited; for the regulation of
the visitors the generally nearby person of big Larry
Riley, the policeman, amply sufficed.  One other
outsider seemed, however, to have a regular connection
with the establishment, and this person early excited
Violet's curiosity.
</p>

<p>
Dressed in the extreme of fashion, as fashion is
known from Fourteenth Street southward, his gray,
almost white, suits always fresh from the pressing-iron,
and his flowered tie and ever evident gay silk
handkerchief always glaringly new, this dapper, dark
young man was unmistakably Neapolitan.  His glossy
black hair clustered tight over his forehead; his
brown skin shone as if rubbed with oil; his eyes
danced like merry, but sinister, bits of coal, and his
too red lips were continuously, loosely, patterned
to a smile that was more nearly contemptuous than
good-humored.
</p>

<p>
For at least a part of every evening this Italian,
who always entered the house from the rear
and without the formality of knocking, sat in
the kitchen, drinking his beer with infinite
leisure and, in the intervals of her discussions in
the parlor, condescended to talk, lazily, with
Rose.
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?" asked Violet, on what was perhaps
the fifth of his visits that she had happened to
observe.
</p>

<p>
Celeste, to whom the question had been addressed,
shrugged her smooth shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"He ees Angel," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"He don't look like one."
</p>

<p>
"No, not mooch, but hees name, eet ees that:
Rafael Angelelli.  Eef he had the moostache, he
would be almost 'andsome."
</p>

<p>
"Rose acts like she thought a good deal of him
as he is."
</p>

<p>
"But why not?"&mdash;Celeste raised her heavy brows.
"'e ees 'er sweed'eart."
</p>

<p>
"He is?" repeated Violet, who could not yet
understand the masculine lover that would batten
upon his conquest.  "I notice he pretty nearly lives
here, an' he never pays out a cent, an' never seems
to work at anything, an' he always wears good
clothes."
</p>

<p>
"My child, truly!  That is the reason that I have
tol' you: 'e ees 'er sweed'eart."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's queer," said Violet, remembering
another caller to whom, though he was a less frequent
visitor, Rose was equally attentive.  "I don't think
he's half as nice as that fellow who comes here in
a taxi&mdash;the one that always wears a dress-suit an'
sits in the back parlor.  He's a swell."
</p>

<p>
But at this Celeste grew enigmatic.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she said, "that ees deeferent"&mdash;and would
say no more.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, it happened, not long afterward,
when the black Cassie was absent on her "evening
out," that Violet, descending the back stair in unshod
feet to steal from the ice-chest&mdash;as was her
companions' custom&mdash;a quiet bottle of the beer that she
had come to like, was brought to a palpitating stop
by the sound, just then, of Rose's and Angel's voices
from the kitchen but a few steps below her.  The
pair were plainly engaged in an important conversation,
the woman hurried and frightened, the man
cold and obdurate.
</p>

<p>
"Naw," said the Neapolitan; "I maka naw move
out o' deesa house."
</p>

<p>
"But he's coming in now, I tell you," Rose almost
supplicated.  "He'll be in the back-parlor in half
a minute, an' I've got to go in an' talk to him."
</p>

<p>
"Olla righta; you go; I go alonga you."
</p>

<p>
"You can't do that; you know you can't.  You
know how things are without my tellin' you.  What
makes you so stubborn all of a sudden?"
</p>

<p>
"I don' lika dees Meesta Wesley Dyker."
</p>

<p>
"That's no reason why you should double-cross me."
</p>

<p>
"'E's too mucha de fina gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"I don't care what he is; you ought to know what
I am.  Do you want to tear up your own meal-ticket
and throw down your easy money?"
</p>

<p>
"Easy mon'?  You maka de joke!"
</p>

<p>
The woman's voice noticeably changed.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean you want some more coin?" she
asked.
</p>

<p>
The Italian did not answer.
</p>

<p>
"Because I won't give it to you," Rose continued,
anger darting into her still cautiously lowered voice.
"I know what you're doing with it.  I know you
had a girl from a department store out at shows twice
last week, an' the second time she had a new dress
on."
</p>

<p>
Somewhere in the front of the house a door closed
heavily.
</p>

<p>
"'E's comin'," the Italian coolly commented.
"Do you wanta that I go along in with you?"
</p>

<p>
As quickly as it had entered, all the anger fled
from Rose's voice, and Violet, accustomed to it in
command or at satisfied ease, was amazed now to
hear it swaying between terror and genuine affection.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't mean it!" Rose pleaded.  "I didn't
believe it when I heard it an' I don't believe it now,
I know how much it costs a fellow to live.  Here's
another ten-spot.  I&mdash;I&mdash;you know how I hate
Dyker, and Angel, you know that I love you!"
</p>

<p>
The listener heard Angelelli rise and heard even
his voice soften, though probably less with affection
than with gratification.
</p>

<p>
"Now you talka lika de person witha gooda
sense," he said.  "Don' you listen to de beega lie no
more.  I lika you&mdash;nobody but only you.  You are de
gooda girl."
</p>

<p>
There was a whispered word more, and then the
kitchen door was softly shut and Violet heard Rose,
going into the next room, welcome that Wesley Dyker
who, Violet had, to Celeste, so favorably compared
with Angel.
</p>

<p>
The woman on the stairs hesitated.  She wanted
to pursue her eavesdropping, and she knew that she
could regain her room, should the doorbell ring,
before she was likely to be missed; but she was afraid
that, in the maid's absence, Rose might return to the
kitchen for a bottle of wine and discover her.
Accordingly she waited the few minutes that were
required for the first of such errands, and, those over,
crept forward to the lighted keyhole, ready to retreat
at the first intimation of danger.
</p>

<p>
She gave her eye precedence over her ear, and, as
it chanced that Dyker was sitting directly in the
limited shaft of her vision, she was enabled to get
what was her first careful view of him.
</p>

<p>
A man but little beyond thirty, Wesley Dyker's
face, which might once well have been handsome,
was beginning to show that flaccid whiteness which
must later light to red and glow to purple.  What
his mouth might have told, a crisp, short, brown
mustache concealed, but the regularity of his other
features lost much of its effect because of eyes that,
though large and steel gray, were heavy-lidded and
calculating.  Nevertheless, Violet's estimate of the
man was not without justification.  He spoke easily
and well in the voice of education; his excellently
made evening clothes displayed a figure that had not
yet lost its admirable lines, and even the face&mdash;to
one that either had known it during its gradual
changes, or to one that lacked a fund of experience
for purposes of comparison&mdash;was not wanting in
attraction.
</p>

<p>
To the sturdy Rose, whose hand he held and who
was looking at him with what she patently believed
to be a tender expression, he was speaking with a
certain formal politeness that was novel in the ears
of the listener.
</p>

<p>
"You think you can get it?" Rose was asking.
</p>

<p>
"I think that I have something more than a
fighting chance," replied Dyker.
</p>

<p>
"What does O'Malley say?"
</p>

<p>
"He is at least as liberal in his promise to me
as he is in his promise to the other man."
</p>

<p>
"And the big chief doesn't yip?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear Rose, you should know, by this time,
enough of New York politics to realize that the
first qualification of a big boss is to hold his tongue,
and that the present incumbent, whatever his other
shortcomings, can always keep quiet as long as he has
no pen in his hand."
</p>

<p>
Rose freed her hand to pour the wine.
</p>

<p>
"May I smoke?" asked Dyker.
</p>

<p>
"You always ask me that, and you always know
you can."
</p>

<p>
He bowed and, drawing a cigarette from a plain
gun-metal case, lighted it.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," he pursued, "I expect to win&mdash;I
always expect to win, because failure may fight its
way to a perch on any man's banner, but it's sure to
lodge on the standard of the man that sits and waits
for it.  But I can't be sure of O'Malley."
</p>

<p>
"I guess whatever headquarters orders will go
with him, all right."
</p>

<p>
"On the surface, perhaps; but, if he wants to, he
can have his own candidate run on an independent
ticket, and then he can quietly knife me at the polls."
</p>

<p>
"Would he have the nerve?"
</p>

<p>
"It is precisely what he did election before last.
I am sure of that, and yet nobody has ever been able
to prove it.  That is where I look for your help."
</p>

<p>
Rose took his hand again, and pressed it reassuringly.
</p>

<p>
"I always take care of my friends," she smiled,
"and you sure have been good to me.  Where do I
come in on this game?"
</p>

<p>
"Just yet you don't have to come in at all.  It
may be that everything will be honest and above-board&mdash;I
trust it will&mdash;and in that case you need not
disturb yourself."
</p>

<p>
"But if it ain't?"
</p>

<p>
"If it isn't,"&mdash;he looked at her kindly, but keenly,
from under his heavy lids&mdash;"I shall want you to
let me know just as soon as O'Malley begins to make
preparations for registering voters from this house."
</p>

<p>
Rose bent forward and kissed him lightly on his
flaccid cheek.
</p>

<p>
"That's easy," she laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, but if you have to go so far at first,
you will have to go farther afterward."
</p>

<p>
"An' now?"
</p>

<p>
"Just now I want you to keep your ears open
for gossip.  You are in a position to hear a lot: in
this house men talk that are dumb outside."
</p>

<p>
"Who are you thinkin' of?"
</p>

<p>
"Several people, friends of O'Malley's.  There's
one cheap little camp-follower who, I am told, gets
around here rather frequently.  I don't suppose that
he's of enough importance to know much, but he
would be worth watching."
</p>

<p>
"What's his name?"
</p>

<p>
Dyker filled Rose's glass, and poured more wine
for himself.
</p>

<p>
"Angelelli," he answered.
</p>

<p>
From the darkened kitchen, Violet, her eye now
fast to the keyhole, drew a short breath, and watched
Rose as the sophisticated spectator watches an
emotional actress when she approaches her "big
scene."  But Rose, still the primitive Teuton of the
brewery-calendar, never quavered.
</p>

<p>
"Rafael Angelelli?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I think so.  He is a little Italian loafer with no
work and plenty of money.  You know him, of
course?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure I know him.  He's in an' out of here all
the time.  We call him 'Angel'."
</p>

<p>
"Hum.  Well, there are angels and angels, so
that name may fit him as well as any other.  There
may be nothing to it, but he does hang about O'Malley
a good deal, and it might be worth your while
to find out what, if anything, he knows."
</p>

<p>
"That's easy," purred Rose.  "Here's success."
</p>

<p>
The pair clinked their glasses, and drained them.
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;Rose?" began Dyker.
</p>

<p>
"Yes?"
</p>

<p>
"Neither this little fellow nor any of his crowd
knows about&mdash;us?"
</p>

<p>
Rose's placid smile was eminently convincing.
</p>

<p>
"I guess I know my business," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I dare say you do.  Only don't let him know
that you know mine."
</p>

<p>
"Trust me for that, Wes' dear."
</p>

<p>
"Because, if O'Malley could get hold of it, he
would have a rather formidable weapon."
</p>

<p>
"He doesn't know I ever set my lamps on you."
</p>

<p>
"Good," said Dyker; "and he mustn't know it
for a good many months to come.  Now, then, let's
have just one pint more between us&mdash;only a pint&mdash;my
dear&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But the woman at the keyhole waited to hear no
more.

IX
<br><br>
THE COURT OF A MERCHANT-PRINCE
</h3>

<p>
When that injudicious grasping of the
third-rail had snuffed out the low, but
stubborn, flame that a foreman had known as
"Number 12," and a few score of human beings
had called Michael Flanagan, his wife, Bridget, had
looked up from her washtub long enough to refuse
the offer of a hundred dollars, made by the
company's claim-adjuster as full payment for whatever
inconvenience she might have been occasioned by
her husband's demise.  One of those very modern
young lawyers, whose livelihood depends upon their
study of the newspapers, and the speed of their feet,
had arrived at the Flanagan tenement ahead of the
adjuster.  He had accepted a contingent fee of ten
dollars, and thereafter, being defeated by the
company's expert attorneys in a lower court, refused, as
usual, to appeal unless the widow handed him a
further amount of money that was wholly beyond
her reach.  So Irish-eyed Katie was put to work, as
she should in any case have been put, and
Mrs. Flanagan went on with her washing.
</p>

<p>
The girl's first position was in a second-hand
clothing shop on Sixth Avenue, where she went to work
at eight in the morning and quit at half-past ten at
night.  The stock-in-trade of this place was largely
revived ball-gowns and opera cloaks, bought, for
the most part, from women of so much means as
to pretend, at least, that they never wore the same
gown twice, and yet of too much thrift to give their
discarded clothes to charity.  Its patrons were persons
that the original wearers of the gowns would have
blushed to meet.  And its proprietress was a little
lynx-eyed, hook-nosed person whose sole object in
life was to induce the former class to sell for less
than they had intended and to persuade the latter
class to buy for more than they could afford.
</p>

<p>
The virtue of this method she impressed, by precept
and example, upon her six girl-clerks, and she
raised their profits as they raised their prices of sale.
She told, with a fine pride, how she had once so
conducted a negotiation that a Riverside Drive
husband had paid her nearly as much for a dress that
he was buying for a Forty-seventh Street acquaintance
as he had first paid for the same dress when it was
made for his wife.
</p>

<p>
But, commissions to the contrary notwithstanding,
neither Katie nor her companions could earn
anything beyond a bare living wage.  The lure of
clothes was always before them; their work was the
handling and the praising of beautiful fabrics
beautifully arranged.  They were told that they might
themselves buy of these at what the proprietress
called a mere nothing above the cost price, but what
was really a considerable increase over it; they
wanted to look their best among their friends, and
their employer insisted that they look their best to
her patrons; there was not one of the half-dozen
clerks that was not continually from fifteen to a
hundred dollars in her mistress's debt.
</p>

<p>
That Katie, like many another making the same
fight, escaped further contamination, that the
contrast between the oppression of the hook-nosed owner
on the one hand and the apparent ease and luxury
of her customers on the other, did not tempt her,&mdash;for
opportunities were plenty,&mdash;from the station of
clerk to purchaser, was due in part to her own sturdy
character and to the accident of her own Celtic
temper.  Other girls there were who were not so
destined, but Mrs. Flanagan's weary feet one day
refused to support their possessor, and Katie, knowing
well the need of ready money for the doctor and the
druggist, neglected to purchase, even on credit, an
expensive black walking-suit that was repeatedly
called to her attention.
</p>

<p>
"Say, you'd look just grand in this," said the
psittacidic proprietress, Mrs. Binks.
</p>

<p>
She held the dress extended, putting its best
points to the light.  And all the other clerks
echoed:
</p>

<p>
"You'd look just grand in it, Miss Flanagan!"
</p>

<p>
"I would that," replied Katie, who was as taciturn
to her employer as she was loquacious to
everybody else.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you take it?" asked Mrs. Binks.
</p>

<p>
"I don't just like it," lied Katie.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Binks blinked her bead-like eyes.  That the
girl's reply could be true was inconceivable.
</p>

<p>
"Try it on," she suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Where's the use?  I don't want it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, try it on anyway."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be too busy, Mrs. Binks.  The customers 're
startin' to pour in this very minute."
</p>

<p>
"Then try it on at your lunch time.  I'll leave it
handy here, over this chair."
</p>

<p>
She did leave it there all day long.  Katie, whose
one dress was now, in spite of endless feminine
make-shifts, beginning to show wear, had to go through
her task with the baited hook constantly dangling
before her.  Nevertheless, when the long-delayed
closing hour arrived, the suit was just where
Mrs. Binks had left it.  Katie carefully abstained from
touching it; she would not even put it away.
</p>

<p>
"What's this?" asked the mildly surprised owner,
as she stumbled over the garment.  "I declare it's
that handsome walking-suit I wanted you to have,
Miss Flanagan."
</p>

<p>
Katie turned and regarded the neglected garment
precisely as Mrs. Binks was regarding it.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," she said, "and is it, now?"
</p>

<p>
Her mistress looked at her, again blinking
suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"Did you try it on?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I want it."
</p>

<p>
"It's a fine suit."
</p>

<p>
"It's grand."
</p>

<p>
"But you don't want it?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I do."
</p>

<p>
"I told you that you could have it for a third off."
</p>

<p>
"I know you did that, Mrs. Binks, and it's thank
you I do for your kindness."
</p>

<p>
"Hum&mdash;hum.  I'll take off a dollar more&mdash;for you."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, no, Mrs. Binks.  Good-night, Mrs. Binks."
</p>

<p>
This sort of thing went on, with variations, for
three days, at the end of which time Mrs. Binks,
as she would have phrased the occurrence, "came
right out with it"; and for this ceremony she chose
that morning hour when the other girls in the shop
had the greatest amount of leisure to observe what
happened.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Flanagan," said she, marching up to the
thoroughly prepared Katie, and peering hard into
the serene Irish eyes of her selected victim, "I like
my clerks to look well."
</p>

<p>
"So I've been noticin'," said Katie.
</p>

<p>
"An' I don't like to speak about it when they
don't," continued Mrs. Binks.
</p>

<p>
"You're just that tender-hearted!"
</p>

<p>
"But if you girls don't wear good clothes, my
customers'll think I don't treat you right."
</p>

<p>
"How could they now, Mrs. Binks?"
</p>

<p>
"And," concluded Mrs. Binks, overlooking these
interruptions in view of the crushing climax she was
approaching, "as you've made up your mind not
to take the hints I've been givin' you, or the fine
offers I've made you, I've got to say it plainly that
you're looking too shabby to work any more for me."
</p>

<p>
Katie smiled her warmest smile.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Binks," she replied, resorting again to
prevarication, and presenting the greedily seized
money that she still owed her employer, "I'd begun
to be afraid that maybe them was your feelin's, an'
so yesterd'y at lunch time I bought me the exact
duplicate of that walking-suit you've been tryin' to
thrust upon me&mdash;only I got it next door an' for half
your price."
</p>

<p>
Saying this she had walked to the shallow closet in
the fitting-room, taken down her hat and coat, put
them on, sung "Good-by" to her consternated
fellow-workers, and strolled away forever from that
place of employment.  She went smiling, but, instead
of the curt word that she generally employed, she
administered a hand-slap with her open palm to a
stranger that accosted her on her journey homeward.
</p>

<p>
She got work, after some searching, in a candy
shop on Eighth Street, but this she had to relinquish
when her mother's speedy illness developed into a
brief and fatal disease.  It was not until the last
nursing, relieved by Hermann's assistance, and the
funeral were over, that she could again think of
labor, and then it was only to get, in a Fourth Street
necktie factory, a small position that she lost
because she had the effrontery to resent the rather
frank overtures of the foreman.
</p>

<p>
Now, although she had told her cheerful lover
nothing about it, she had come to the last ditch.
She had been deceived by advertisements, cheated
by employment agencies, denied work by the
superintendents of scores of shops and manufactories.  She
was not a skilled laborer, and she had, at first, nothing
in the matter of recommendation; she belonged
to no trade union; the rent for her little room was
dangerously overdue; so, also, were the bills of the
baker and the milk dealer upon whom alone she was
depending for food; all that she could pledge was
in pawn, and, with the soles of her shoes worn
through almost to her feet, the elaborate mourning
costume that she had been unable to resist was her
only badge of material prosperity.
</p>

<p>
Two avenues of escape were open, were even
persistently presented, yet she would regard neither.
To take what Hermann pleaded with her to accept,
though her hungry heart and her underfed body
cried out for it, would have been, she felt well
assured, unfairly to handicap her best friend, and, as
for turning into that other way&mdash;a way into which
the streets on every hand seemed so easily to open,
she was too wise to consider.
</p>

<p>
"No thanks," she answered in her soul, as she
walked by the leering satyrs, with her black head
erect and her lips compressed&mdash;"not yet, if you
please: not yet, nor never, I think, for starvin' seems
some easier and a deal quicker, too."
</p>

<p>
She had to repeat the words pretty often, for they
had come to be a sort of incantation, almost a pious
ejaculation, against the enemy, and, as her poverty
grew and her chances decreased in inverse ratio,
the enemy, like vultures flocking to the fatally
wounded, seemed startlingly to increase in force.  At
first it was a well-dressed corps strayed from Broadway
or the Avenue; then it was the bank-clerk hurrying
to work and the master mechanic hurrying from
it; but finally, so plain are the signs of distress
shown upon our faces by the selves that are besieged,
it had become the professionally employing,
professedly unemployed.
</p>

<p>
Yet at every dawn she renewed her quest, with a
glass of blue milk and a bite of bread for breakfast.
Every day and all day she tramped the long, aching
streets.  And every night, despairing but resolute,
she came home for her supper of bread and milk
and for the sleep of the hungry and distressed.
</p>

<p>
It was now a Thursday morning.  The milkman
had pounded at her door and, receiving no answer,
had left no milk.  Still gnawing her crust, Katie
slunk out of the tenement, and, at the step, was
waylaid by the rent-collector, a little man with a
sharp, white face that told plainly of his own
struggle.  He blocked the exit.
</p>

<p>
"Good-day to you, Miss Flanagan," he said,
touching his dirty cap.
</p>

<p>
"Good-mornin', Mr. Woods," she answered,
aware that the hour for the last engagement was
approaching.
</p>

<p>
The man was one whose business forced him to
mince nothing.
</p>

<p>
"I was comin' up to git yer rent," he continued.
"It's three weeks overdue."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I'll have to be askin' you to let it
run a bit longer," said Katie, and her voice, in spite
of all resolution, trembled.
</p>

<p>
"But I've been an' done that twice fer you, Miss
Flanagan.  The boss is after me as hard as I'm after
you&mdash;an' harder."
</p>

<p>
"I know it.  I&mdash;you can't stand him off another
week, Mr. Woods?"
</p>

<p>
"Nix on the stand-off, miss."
</p>

<p>
"You see, I'm&mdash;I'm out of a job."
</p>

<p>
"I know that, but then you've been out o' one
fer a good while now."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, only I rather expect&mdash;indeed, I've been
promised one beginnin' to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
The little man coughed behind a dirty hand.
</p>

<p>
"That's Friday?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"It is that."
</p>

<p>
"Well, ain't you got your dates mixed?  You
told me last week you had a job promised for that
Friday."
</p>

<p>
Katie surprised even herself: she laughed.
</p>

<p>
"So I did!" she said.  "An' of course I was
lyin' an' of course you knowed it.  Oh, well, Woods,
man, hold 'em off for forty-eight hours, an' if I
don't get work then, I'll&mdash;well, I won't bother you
no more."
</p>

<p>
In the shadowy hallway, she felt his eyes studying
her less with evil than with wonder.
</p>

<p>
"There ain't many girls with your looks, Miss
Flanagan, as'd be out of a job as long as you've
been."
</p>

<p>
Katie shrugged her shoulders: she was beyond
resentment.
</p>

<p>
"The more pity to 'em," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Not many," repeated Mr. Woods.
</p>

<p>
There was an awkward silence.  The collector
paused because he wanted her fully to weigh an
implication that he honestly considered to contain sound
advice, and Katie refrained from further comment
for the excellent reason that she had nothing to say.
It was Woods that at last took up the broken thread.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you what I'll do, Miss Flanagan," he
not unkindly concluded; "I'll hold 'em off till
to-morrow evenin', an' if by then you can pay me a
chunk on account, it'll be all right; if you can't&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He stood aside, and Katie clapped him warmly on
the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"You're doin' your best, Woods," she said, "an'
I thank you for it.  I'll get the job someways, but
not the way you think, an'&mdash;an' I thank you."
</p>

<p>
Only half-way to the corner she met the girl that
lived across the hall from her, Carrie Berkowicz, a
homely, round-cheeked, brown-haired Lithuanian
Jewess, who worked in a shirtwaist factory on Tenth
Street.
</p>

<p>
"Say, Katie"&mdash;Carrie prided herself on her colloquial
English, as she learned it in the night-classes
in the Rand School&mdash;"were you still looking for a
job?"
</p>

<p>
Katie nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Well, say, I just this minute passed Emma
Schrem, an' she says Cora Costigan is quitting her
job at the Lennox store to-day to be married
to-morrow.  Why don't you pull up there and try
for it?"
</p>

<p>
Try for it?  Katie could scarcely stop to thank
her rescuer before she had turned northward.  There
was no longer left her even the five cents necessary
for carfare, and, though she was faint with hunger
and shaking with fear lest her tardiness should lose
her this slim opportunity, she was forced to walk.
Facing a fine rain blown in from the Sound, she
walked up Second Avenue, and finally, turning
westward to the shopping quarter now crowded with
salesgirls on their hurried way to work, she entered,
by the dark employés' door, the large department-store
of Joshua N. Lennox, merchant and philanthropist.
</p>

<p>
A dozen quick inquiries rushed her, wet and weary,
but flushed by her walk and radiant with the excitement
of the race, into the presence of the frock-coated,
pale-faced, suave-mouthed Mr. Porter, the
tall, thin man, with the precision of a surgeon and
the gravity of a Sunday-school superintendent, to
whose attention, it appeared, such pleas as hers must
be brought.  Mr. Porter, who had gray side-whiskers,
which he stroked with white hands, listened in
judicial calm to what she had to say.
</p>

<p>
"Just fill out this application-blank," he remarked
as, breathless, Katie ended her little speech.
</p>

<p>
They were in a dim, bare office under the street,
the man at a roll-top desk lighted by a green-shaded
incandescent lamp, the girl standing beside him.
Mr. Porter indicated a writing-shelf along the
opposite wall, where Katie found a pile of the blanks,
and pen and ink.  While she struggled with the task
assigned her, Mr. Porter verified, by brief, sharp
inquiries through a telephone, her statement of the
approaching marriage of Miss Cora Costigan.
</p>

<p>
Katie, meanwhile, was giving her age, her parentage,
her birthplace, the name of the firm that had
last employed her&mdash;she mentioned the candy-shop
for that,&mdash;was cheerfully agreeing to join the
"Employés' Mutual Benefit Association," and was
putting a "Yes," which she intended promptly to
forget, to the question that asked her to become a spy
on her co-workers: "If you saw a fellow-employé
doing anything detrimental to the interests of the
firm, would you consider it your duty to report the
same?"  It was only at one of the last questions
that she hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Please what does that mean?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Porter deigned to walk across the room and,
close to her shoulder, examined the question.  It
was the simple one: "Do you live with your parents?"
</p>

<p>
"That," said Mr. Porter, "is inserted because
the firm wishes to have only nice girls here, and
those with good home influences are considered&mdash;most
trustworthy."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Porter had the type of emotionless eyes that
can say one sort of thing far better than the eyes of
more temperamental people, and he now met Katie's
steady gaze with a stare of considerable significance.
</p>

<p>
Katie was rather sure that she understood.
</p>

<p>
"So that," she said, "if I didn't live with my
people, I couldn't have the job?"
</p>

<p>
"So that," Mr. Porter corrected, "if a girl does
get a position and lives with her family, she will be
better cared for, and we will know that she is safe
at home evenings."
</p>

<p>
Katie hesitated no longer.  She took the pen and,
opposite the query, wrote a quick "Yes."  To be
sure she was, on that account, obliged to invent the
kind of work done by her father and the amount of
the family wage; but she so needed the position that
her active wit at once supplied the answers.  More
or less truthfully, she put a word in reply to the
remaining questions, signed her name, and wrote her
address.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Porter took the paper in his white fingers,
read it slowly, folded it, indorsed it with several
hieroglyphics, and placed it in a pigeon-hole.
</p>

<p>
"I am filing this with our other applications,"
he said.  "As soon as your name is reached, I will
see that you are notified."
</p>

<p>
Katie's jaw dropped.
</p>

<p>
"But I thought," she began, "I thought I was
to get the job now.  I&mdash;isn't Cora leavin', thin, after
all?"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Costigan is leaving us, I understand," said
Mr. Porter, stroking his whiskers; "but there are
others&mdash;nearly a hundred&mdash;on the list ahead of you."
</p>

<p>
Katie was hungry, and hunger finds it hard to
think of justice.  She had borne all that she could
bear.  The waiting, the walking, the hope and the
hopelessness had gnawed the string of her courage.
Something snapped inside of her, and she began to
sob with Irish unrestraint.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Porter was embarrassed.  He frequently had
to deal harshly with other employés of his
philanthropic employer&mdash;it was, in fact, upon the
performance of such duties that his living almost
depended&mdash;but he did not like to have tears shed in
his office: it did not look well for the reputation of
the establishment.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Miss&mdash;Miss Flanagan," said he, first
consulting the application-blank for the forgotten
name, and putting one of his white hands toward
the face now hidden in a crumpled handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't&mdash;really, you must not!"
</p>

<p>
"But everything depends on me gettin' this job!"
sobbed Katie in an Irish wail.  "The rent's due;
me family's all sick; the milkman won't leave no
more milk, an' I've eaten nothin' for Heaven knows
how long!"
</p>

<p>
In a rush of words her story, including that of
her resurrected father, leaped from her.  What effect
it would have had upon Mr. Porter had it been
calmly told is beyond guessing; but it was told by
no means calmly, and Katie's voice rose to a pitch
that forced him to surrender out of mere fear of
a prolonged scene.  Grudgingly, but unconditionally,
he laid down his arms.  He took the telephone and
called again Miss Isaacs, the buyer of the women's
hosiery department, which Miss Costigan was to
leave on the following day, told as much of Katie's
story as he thought necessary, and obtained consent
to a trial of the girl.  He informed Katie that she
might take, on the next morning, the place to be
vacated by Miss Costigan, but he took care to
impress upon her mind the fact that he was doing her
an exceptional favor, which she was not to mention
to her friends, who might try to profit by her
unusual experience.
</p>

<p>
Katie was on the point of calling all the saints
to bless him when she bethought her of a practical
inquiry theretofore, in her eagerness to secure any
sort of work, neglected.
</p>

<p>
"An' what's the pay?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"You will receive," replied Mr. Porter in the
tones in which his employer announced the gift of
a small fortune to a large college, "four dollars and
fifty cents a week."
</p>

<p>
Katie forgot the saints.
</p>

<p>
"Four&mdash;" she began.  "But, Mr. Porter," she
concluded, "will you be tellin' me how I'm to be
livin' on all that?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Porter's calm eyes came again into significant
play.
</p>

<p>
"You have said in your application, you may
recall," he dryly remarked, as he reached for that
document, "you have said that you lived with your
father."
</p>

<p>
For a moment her glance probed his.
</p>

<p>
"But for all that," she said, "I have to support
meself entirely."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Porter was still looking at her with his
emotionless, appraising gaze.  He saw a girl with pretty,
piquant features, with glossy black hair, with cheeks
that bloomed even in privation and blue eyes that
were beautiful even in tears.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Flanagan," said he, "most of the girls
that start at these wages in department-stores are
partly supported by their family or have some friend
to help them out."
</p>

<p>
Katie flushed, but she kept her outward calm.
</p>

<p>
"An' what if they haven't got a friend?" she
inquired.
</p>

<p>
Porter's cold eye never wavered.
</p>

<p>
"They find one," he said; "and I may add, Miss
Flanagan, that you should experience no difficulty in
that direction."
</p>

<p>
Poverty will do much for most of us.  For Katie
it succeeded in curbing a temper that, in better times,
was never docile.  Beggars, she reflected, cannot
afford to look too closely into the source or
significance of the alms they have asked.  She swallowed
her wrath.
</p>

<p>
"Will you advance one week's salary now?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Porter was distinctly surprised.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;why, certainly I won't!" he stammered.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear Miss Flanagan, I have nothing
to do with the payment of the salaries.  Besides,
this firm doesn't know you; it does not even know
that you will come to-morrow; it does not know
that, if you do come, you will remain."
</p>

<p>
Katie smiled insidiously, and Katie smiling
through her tear-curled lashes was insidious indeed.
</p>

<p>
"Och, now, Mr. Porter," she protested.  "That's
all well enough for the green girls; but you an'
I know that you're the boss in matters of this sort.
Lend me two an' a quarter."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Porter, pleased in spite of himself by her
flattery, protested, but Katie remained unconvinced.
She declared that she knew he was the real authority
and that she could not bear to hear him underestimate
himself.  And the upshot of the discussion was that,
though Mr. Porter could, in his official capacity, do
nothing so unbusinesslike as to make her an advance,
he would, personally, be glad to oblige her with a
dollar and a half, and oblige her, adding a fatherly
pat to her pink cheek, he ultimately did.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," Katie responded as she took the
money, and turned to go.  "I'll report to-morrow,
then, at a quarter of eight, Mr. Porter."
</p>

<p>
"At quarter to eight," repeated Mr. Porter,
slowly closing the door behind her.
</p>

<p>
But, out in the wet street, Katie was saying what
she had refrained from saying in the darkened office.
</p>

<p>
"An' as for the pay," she concluded, "I can't
buy no automobiles with me loose change; but I
think you'll find, you limb of Satan, that I can keep
body an' soul together without a friend in the
wor'rld!"

ANOTHER SPHERE
</h3>

<p>
That same evening, his crisp brown mustache
hiding the meaning of his mouth, and his
drooping lids concealing the purpose of his
steel-gray eyes, Wesley Dyker, from the rooms he
had rented in an East Side Assembly district, took
a cab northwestward through the rain to Riverside
Drive.  He was dressed precisely as he dressed to
go to the house of Rose Légère, but he was bound
for the house of Joshua Lennox.
</p>

<p>
There he had plainly been expected.  The liveried,
tight-lipped servant, who opened the iron grill-work
door for him, showed him deferentially down a long
tiled hall and into, not the formal white and gilt
reception-room, but a comfortable, dimly-lighted
apartment, a smoking-room, hung with fading mediæval
tapestries, the floor covered with deep rugs of
the Orient, and the chairs wide, broad-armed, and
upholstered in soft leather.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Lennox will be down in a moment, sir,"
said the servant.  "May I bring you anything,
Mr. Dyker?"
</p>

<p>
Wesley shook his well-shaped head.
</p>

<p>
"No, thank you, Charles," he answered, and then,
nodding to a decanter that, under a wide, soft-shaded
lamp, stood upon a corner table: "Irish?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Charles bowed, brought a tray, and, when Dyker
had poured the whiskey, added some seltzer, and
lighted the cigarette that the guest had taken from
a wrought silver box on a nearby tabouret.
</p>

<p>
"That is all, Charles," said Dyker, and the
servant silently left him alone.
</p>

<p>
Wesley sank back in his chair with a sigh of
comfort.  He liked the house of the philanthropic
merchant so well that he could have wished its master
liked him better, and when, within a few minutes,
the master himself chanced into the room, Dyker
was prepared to be diplomatic.
</p>

<p>
Joshua N. Lennox was the explanation of that
Mr. Porter who held so much power under him.
The latter was tall and thin, the former short and
compact, but there all physical differences ended:
Mr. Porter had found his model in his employer.
Here was the source of the seneschal's gray hair
and side-whiskers, his trap mouth tortured to the
line of benevolence, his calm gaze and his manner
that combined the precision of the surgeon with the
gravity of the head of a Sunday-school.  Mr. Lennox,
in fact, conducted the second largest Bible Class
in New York.  He knew its textbook from the first
chapter of Genesis to the twenty-second chapter of
the Revelation, and he believed in the literal inspiration
of every verse of the original and of every syllable
of the English translation.
</p>

<p>
It was in the voice in which he habitually
addressed his Bible Class, the voice of one uttering a
benediction, that he said:
</p>

<p>
"Good-evening, Mr. Dyker."
</p>

<p>
Wesley put down his glass and rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
The man before him was the perfection of that
noble work of Heaven, a Prominent Citizen.  Joshua
Lennox endowed Bowery chapels with organs and
meat-supplies; he contributed heavily to missions
among the benighted Japanese; he assisted in
arbitrating strikes wherein his fellow-employers were
concerned; he always served on memorial committees;
and he regularly subscribed to the campaign
funds of all movements toward municipal political
reform.
</p>

<p>
If his climbing wife insisted upon having liquor
in the house, Mr. Lennox never touched it.  If she
served tobacco, he did not smoke.  If she took in
a Sunday paper, written and printed on Saturday,
he would read no news until the appearance of the
Monday journal merely written and printed on Sunday.
And if his mercantile establishment sold poker-chips
under the pseudonym of "counters," he was
aware only that it did not sell playing-cards.  The
business he considered as his creation had grown
beyond the limits of his power, and though, a good man
and sincere, he might have done something by
keeping a closer eye upon his work, he was in reality
as much the creature of conditions as his worst-paid
cash-boy.  The great Frederick complained that a
monarch could not know all the evil done in his
kingdom: Joshua Lennox was so busy benefiting
mankind that he had no leisure to observe in his own
shop the state of affairs that made his philanthropy
financially possible.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you are going with us to the opera,
Mr. Lennox," said Dyker.
</p>

<p>
The old man shook his silvered head.
</p>

<p>
"No," said he in the slow, deliberate utterance
that he had acquired with his first million of dollars;
"I am on my way farther down town than that."
</p>

<p>
"But you had better come," urged Wesley, knowing
that refusal was certain.  "This is the last
performance of the season."
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary," the merchant chuckled kindly,
"I think you had better let Marian go to the opera
alone and come along with me.  I am going to the
first performance of a new season."
</p>

<p>
"Where's that?"
</p>

<p>
"To the Municipal Improvement Mass Meeting
at Cooper Union."
</p>

<p>
That made it Dyker's turn to smile.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but I couldn't do that," he said.  "I'm on
the other side, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Against good government?"  The elder man
manifestly enjoyed this mild thrust.
</p>

<p>
"Against irregularity, Mr. Lennox.  There never
has been and there never can be any lasting reform
from the outside.  We must clean our own houses.
That is why I have moved to my present address.
I believe in reform from within the party, and I
believe that to effect this we want men of your sort
to help us indoors and not to attack us from the
street."
</p>

<p>
The merchant's cold eye looked hard at the
speaker, but Dyker's lowered lids betrayed nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Lennox, dryly; "I heard that when
Tammany Hall first came into power, but I have
never seen any trace of reform from the inside.
What I have seen is the spectacle of most of these
inside reformers developing into leaders of the
machine.  If you will take an older man's advice, you
will withdraw while there is yet time."
</p>

<p>
Wesley's reply sprang ready to his lips, but, before
he could utter it, Marian Lennox came into the
room.
</p>

<p>
Something of herself the girl received, no doubt,
from her climbing mother; something, probably,
from her satisfied father, and more than she guessed
from a narrow environment.  Nevertheless, four
years at college had cultivated in her what seemed
to be a spirit of independence, and a brief life in
the city had confirmed in her what she was certain
were opinions of her own.
</p>

<p>
She was tall and moved with assurance.  Her full
throat rose above the ermine of her cloak, supporting
a delicately carved head, the head of a Greek cameo,
held rigidly erect.  The hair was a rich chestnut, the
eyes large and brown, and the mouth at once firm
and kindly.  Her skin was very fair and her gloved
hands long and slender.
</p>

<p>
She caught her father's concluding words.
</p>

<p>
"While there is yet time," she paraphrased,
"Mr. Dyker will withdraw from this room and get me
to the opera-house before the overture has ended.
I am so unfashionable as to want my music
entire."
</p>

<p>
She was used to commanding her parents in their
own house, and she thought that she was used to
commanding Wesley everywhere, so that she
dismissed Lennox and secured Dyker's entrance into
her waiting limousine with almost no delay whatever.
</p>

<p>
"There," she remarked as she settled herself
comfortably for their drive; "I rather fancy that I
rescued you from a sermon."
</p>

<p>
Dyker laughed shortly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know," he said.  "I esteem your
father so much that I should like him to like me."
</p>

<p>
"But you think that he doesn't like you?"
</p>

<p>
"I think that he is slow to see that two persons
may differ on a question of political tactics and yet
remain, both of them, honest men."
</p>

<p>
"And may they?" bantered Marian.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he lightly accepted the challenge, "I
shall take the specific case.  There is no doubting
your father's sincerity; there is no doubting the
sincerity of nearly all the men that will, with him,
to-night try to launch another of these municipal-reform
parties which, if they ever get started at all,
are sure to run on the rocks at last."
</p>

<p>
"And on the other hand," said the girl, "I suppose
I must generously refuse to doubt the sincerity
of Tammany Hall?"
</p>

<p>
"On the other hand you must justly refuse to
doubt the sincerity of a few young men who have
seen that reform-parties always end in violent
reaction within the city and, if briefly successful,
weaken the party in the next national campaign.
You must refuse to doubt the sincerity of these young
men when they go into the heart of the East Side
to live and work among the people that make up
the organization's fighting-strength.  You must
believe in them when they try to get nominated for
even the smallest offices on the machine-ticket.  And
you must have faith that, if they can work themselves
at last into places of power, they will reform
the party in the only way that will keep it reformed."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me," sighed Marian, "it seems that it was
father that I rescued from a sermon."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Dyker, "you asked me why your
father and I should not mistrust each other, and there
you have the reason.  You know what I am trying
to do; I have told you my plans as I haven't told
them to another human being&mdash;and you should know
that I am not to be suspected."
</p>

<p>
There was a ring in his voice that touched her.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," she said.  "I beg you'll forgive
me.  Only really, you know, you can't expect father
to be with you: he would have to break the habit
of a lifetime."
</p>

<p>
"I don't ask him to be with me; I only ask him
to believe that a man can work with the organization
and yet have pure principles."
</p>

<p>
"He can't even go so far as that; he says that
every system is the reflection of the men that make it,
and he says that the system you support battens on
horrors."
</p>

<p>
"But it can't be the system.  The horrors existed
long before the system.  Is he such a conservative
as not to be able to see that?"
</p>

<p>
"He isn't a conservative; he is the one unprogressive
thing in nature: the liberal of a preceding
generation.  Only the other day I mentioned
something I have been thinking about doing&mdash;something
that several of my most conventional friends have
been doing for ever so long&mdash;and he was so dreadfully
shocked that, though I'm now resolved upon
my course, I can't guess how he'll take it."
</p>

<p>
Dyker's curiosity was easily piqued.
</p>

<p>
"If you proposed it," he said, "I can't imagine
that it was such a very terrible thing."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no; it was merely that I want to be of some
use in the world and so have made up my mind to
go in for settlement-work."
</p>

<p>
Wesley Dyker was one of those rare animals, a
human being whose parents, though they could have
arranged it otherwise, permitted him to be born in
New York.  He had been reared, at least during the
winters of his earlier life, within the Borough of
Manhattan, and his views were, like those of most
of his even less acclimated neighbors, just as wide
as that narrow island, and no wider.  Indeed, so
far as were concerned his views of the proper sphere
of his own womankind, he limited them entirely to
an extremely small portion of the city.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you're joking," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I am in cold earnest," she assured him.
</p>

<p>
"But that's absurd.  You've&mdash;why you don't
know what settlement-work means!"
</p>

<p>
"I know quite well what it means," said Marian.
"I have friends engaged in it, as I told you, and
I've been visiting them and seeing their life at close
quarters."
</p>

<p>
"And you really mean&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I really mean that here we are at the Metropolitan,
and that we can't talk on our way upstairs, and
we won't talk while there is music to listen to."
</p>

<p>
Slowly their car had taken its grudged place in
a long procession of its fellows, one by one unloading
the human freight before the brilliantly lighted
doorway.  The pavement and the steps were a tossing
sea of silk hats, colored scarfs, and glittering
headdresses.  Into this they plunged, hurried to the
crowded elevator, traversed a lighted corridor,
passed through a short, dark passage and came out
to the Lennox box in the great, glaring horseshoe of
the opera-house.
</p>

<p>
Dyker, baffled by the sudden stop that had been
put to his protests, looked moodily upon the familiar
picture.  Below them, climbing to the rail behind
which was massed the orchestra, was the pit, white
bosoms and bare shoulders, too distant to present,
to the unassisted eye, any hint of individuality.
Above rose the teeming galleries, line above line of
peering faces.  And to right and left swept the great
curve of the boxes splendid with lace and feathers
and jewels.
</p>

<p>
He saw no more than that during the entire
performance and, as Marian, even in the <i>entr'actes</i>,
would talk of nothing but the music to which he had
refused to listen, he heard less.  The opera was
"Lucia," and as Wesley, with a taste worthy of a
more discerning critic, considered that work nothing
but a display of vocal gymnastics devised for a
throat abnormally developed, he would probably
have been, in any case, bored.
</p>

<p>
His father, who had what his friends called
"family," had married what everybody called
"money," but had managed to invest that commodity
with a talent for choosing failures, and, when
both parents had died, Wesley, fresh from the
Columbia Law School, had amazedly found himself in
a position where he would actually have to turn his
education to practical account.  For five years he
held a thankless, underpaid and unmentioned
partnership in a well-known firm of corporation-lawyers.
He drew their briefs, and developed a genuine talent
for the task, but he was never given a chance to
plead.  The worm of necessity spun its cocoon in
his brain, but the emerging butterfly of ambition
could find no way to liberty.
</p>

<p>
One day, however, he was commissioned to prepare
the case in defense of a large contractor, quite
justly accused of fraud.  It happened that, when
the young lawyer brought the results of his week's
work to his chief, the client in whose interests the
work had been done was closeted with the head of
the firm, and, Dyker being presented, that contractor
learned of Wesley's service.  At the ensuing trial
the client was acquitted, and remembered the service.
He lived on the East Side and made most of his
money from political jobs.  The rest followed simply
enough.  Dyker was introduced to the powers of
his patron's district, and, thinking that he saw here
the opportunity of which he had begun to despair,
he had left his former employers and was already
shouldering his way forward among his new friends.
His former acquaintances mildly wondered what the
devil he was after; his latter ones began to regard
him as a clever fellow, and the newspapers printed
stories of him as a young society man that gratuitously
gave his legal talents to the help of the poor.
</p>

<p>
For his own part, Dyker was quite certain of
what he was and of what he would be.  He had seen,
beneath his lowered lids, that a clever man could
gain both fortune and power through political
prestige, and he meant to use that means to his end.
He had also, while still with the firm of
corporation-lawyers, been presented to Marian Lennox by her
opportunely-met, socially-aspiring mother, and was,
whatever his relation with other members of her
sex, quite as much in love with her as he could be
with anybody.  Realizing the power of her father's
fortune and the beauty of the girl herself, he had
determined to marry her with as little delay as
possible.
</p>

<p>
Until to-night he had delayed all open pursuit,
because there had not been lacking signs to free him
from fear of all male rivals; but that Marian should
thus suddenly develop a purpose in life meant that
he was to have a rival of a far more formidable sort.
He set his teeth under his crisp mustache, folded
his arms across his heart, and sat stolidly through
the interminable opera: as soon as it was over, he
meant to play his first lead.
</p>

<p>
He did play it&mdash;played it as soon as their car had
crept up in answer to its electric-call and whisked
them away into the night.  As they shot up the flaming
street, her clean-cut profile was almost as distinct
as it had been in the box, and the girl, still thrilling
with the memory of the music she so passionately
loved, was close to the mood best suited to his own.
</p>

<p>
"May I talk now?" he asked ruefully.
</p>

<p>
She smiled.
</p>

<p>
"You mean to ask if you may argue," she
answered.  "No, you may not argue against my
determination, and I am a good deal surprised that a man
of your sort should want to."
</p>

<p>
"I don't intend to argue," he protested, leaning
the merest trifle toward her.  "I mean only to ask
you if your determination is quite fixed."
</p>

<p>
She bowed her splendid head.
</p>

<p>
"Quite fixed," she said.
</p>

<p>
"So that argument would not shake it?"
</p>

<p>
"So that no argument could shake it."
</p>

<p>
"Nor any persuasion?"
</p>

<p>
His voice had sunk only a semi-tone, but her feminine
ear noted the change.
</p>

<p>
"Nor any persuasion," she replied.
</p>

<p>
"Then suppose I presented to you neither argument
nor persuasion, but a condition?"
</p>

<p>
"But there is no conceivable condition that could
arise to change me.  You refuse to understand that
I see this thing as a duty."
</p>

<p>
A lamp stronger than its fellows threw a quick
ray full upon her face; her brown eyes were
charmingly serious, her lips dangerously sweet.
</p>

<p>
"What I understand," responded Dyker, "is that
there is one situation in which a woman may find
herself where there arises a duty that crowds all
others from the board."
</p>

<p>
His hand, in the semi-darkness, sought and found
her own, its glove withdrawn, cool and firm and
unretreating.
</p>

<p>
"You know the situation I mean," he said.  "I
love you.  I love you so much, Marian, that I am
jealous of any work that would take you from me;
I want so much of your love that I can spare none
of it&mdash;none even for the poor and suffering."
</p>

<p>
In that tight grasp her hand fluttered a little, but
she did not answer: she could not answer, because,
while her brain was telling her that a love so
rapacious was necessarily niggardly, her heart was crying
out that this was the love it wanted most of all.
</p>

<p>
"Marian"&mdash;his voice shook now with the emotion
that was tugging at its leash&mdash;"you've known
for some months that I loved you; all last winter
you must have seen this coming; you can't be
unprepared to answer me!"
</p>

<p>
He possessed himself of her other hand, and
pressed her inert palms between his own.
</p>

<p>
But the girl's determination loomed large to her.
Through her entire life she had been shut away
from the real world, behind rich curtains and amid
soft lights, until, fired with the unrest of a partial
education, she had chanced upon a glimpse of classmates
working in what they called the slums, and
now, with all the enthusiasm of youth, she had
resolved to join them.  A maturer woman would not
have taken so seriously a sudden impulse to engage
in work for which she had no training, but Marian
was young.
</p>

<p>
"I am not unprepared," she answered.  "I did
know.  But I know too that there are things that
can make even love a finer, a better emotion."
</p>

<p>
The words reminded her of some speech she had
once heard in a play, and, entirely in earnest as she
was, the sound of them from her own lips strengthened
her.  She was in love with Wesley Dyker, but
she was more in love with renunciation.
</p>

<p>
The man, however, shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said, "love is something ultimate.  You
can't paint the lily; you can't part it and share it;
you must either cherish it or kill it.  Which do you
mean to do?"
</p>

<p>
The car had turned into the smoother way of
Riverside Drive, where the lights are far fewer and
less bright than Broadway's.  He could not see her
face, but he could not doubt the resolve that was
in her voice as she answered:
</p>

<p>
"I mean to take up the work that I have told
you of."
</p>

<p>
"But that's folly, Marian!"
</p>

<p>
He had chosen the wrong term of description, and,
the moment he uttered it, he knew that he had erred.
"Folly" is the word that youth most resents.
</p>

<p>
Marian withdrew her hands.
</p>

<p>
"It is strange," she said, "to hear you, of all
men, laugh at an attempt to help the poor."
</p>

<p>
"I am not laughing; I'm too serious to laugh.
I am so serious that I can't pick and choose phrases.
I meant only that you can't help these people without
training&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I can get training."
</p>

<p>
"Without knowing them?"
</p>

<p>
"The only way to know them is to go to them."
</p>

<p>
"But even then, you can do so little.  These settlements
accomplish practically nothing.  They are fads
for the people that run them and playthings for the
people they are intended to help.  I can speak with
authority, and I tell you that the young men and
women, the boys and girls, that go to them, drop
in only when they have nothing else to do, and all
the rest of the time go their own ways."
</p>

<p>
He forgot that he had said he would not argue.
He used all his power to convince and to persuade;
but if there is one human being that cannot be moved
from a purpose, it is a young girl with a romantic
ideal, smarting under what she conceives to be ridicule,
and for the first time tasting what she believes
to be the bitter-sweets of sacrifice.  Even when the
verbal war had been carried into her own house,
he could bring no concession from her.  If he was
helping his neighbors, then he should be all the more
anxious that she, as the woman he wanted to be his
wife, should have precisely the experience that the
settlement would supply her.
</p>

<p>
"Then you mean," he asked, "that you do care&mdash;that
you care at least a little?"
</p>

<p>
He put out his hands, but she did not seem to
see them.
</p>

<p>
"I mean," she answered, "that we must wait."

XI
<br><br>
UNDER THE LASH
</h3>

<p>
It was on the day following her eavesdropping
upon Rose that Violet was awakened early&mdash;as
early as eleven o'clock in the morning&mdash;by a
sudden cry.  The sound was one of some pain and
more terror, beginning in the high note of horrified
amazement and ending in an attenuating moan of
despair.
</p>

<p>
Violet had been living in a highly charged atmosphere:
she sat up in bed, sleep immediately banished
from her brain.  She remained still and listened.
She heard Rose's now familiar footstep.  She heard
a door open and close.  She heard that cry frightfully
begin again, and then she heard it more frightfully
stop in mid-power, cease in abrupt and hideous
silence.
</p>

<p>
There came a discreet tapping at her own door.
</p>

<p>
"Are you alone, my dear?"
</p>

<p>
It was the deep, contralto voice of English Evelyn,
and, as Violet replied in the affirmative, the woman
softly entered.
</p>

<p>
Her tall, almost thin, figure was draped in a
soiled pink kimona; her yellow hair seemed merely
to have been tossed upon her head and to have been
left precisely as it happened to alight; her blue eyes
were dull, and her hard, narrow face, with its spots
of high color over the cheek-bones, showed more
plainly than common, the usually faint little red
veins that lay close below its white skin.
</p>

<p>
"My Gawd," she sighed, as she sank upon the
bed and curled up at its foot, "there are some things
I can't get accustomed to, and that"&mdash;she nodded
in the direction whence the cry had come&mdash;"that's
one of them."
</p>

<p>
She spoke in a weary voice, a voice with almost
no animation, but with a curious mixture of the
cockney of the New Yorker and with a rising
inflection that saved what she said from monotony.
</p>

<p>
"What was it?" asked Violet.
</p>

<p>
"You ought to know.  It was another of them."
</p>

<p>
"You mean&mdash;&mdash;"  The question trailed into nothingness
on Violet's whitening lips.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Evelyn, seizing a pillow and snuggling
her broad shoulders against it.  "Got a cig?"  And
then, as her hostess produced a box from under
the mattress: "It does so get upon my nerves.  Why,
sometimes they come here young enough to play with
dollies.  This time there was no more sleep for
boiby.  Had to run downstairs and rig a B. and S.,
and then come up to girlie here for company."
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;how did this happen?"
</p>

<p>
"How the deuce do you suppose?  One story is
pretty much all of them, my dear, and one about
as narsty as the others."
</p>

<p>
"But this?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, this broke me up just because I had the
bad luck to hear the details, though I must say I've
heard the same details often enough before.  Her
people lived in a tenement in Essex Street, where
it's so crowded that the men have to come outside
every evening while their wives cook the dinners&mdash;three
nine-by-seven rooms, no barth and no privacy;
four children from eighteen to ten in one room; pa,
ma, the boiby, and the seven-year-old in the second,
and the cot in the kitchen-living-room rented to the
lodger.  The lodger was the wiggly snake under the
apple-tree."
</p>

<p>
"He brought her here?"
</p>

<p>
"Gave her, as you might say, the general directions.
But she'd have come along of her own self
sometime."
</p>

<p>
"How could she?"
</p>

<p>
"How couldn't she, you mean!  Those tenements
are not for living in&mdash;there isn't room for that&mdash;they're
just to eat in, when you've got enough, and
sleep in, when you can sleep, and die in, when you
have to."
</p>

<p>
"So this girl had to live outside?"
</p>

<p>
"On the doorsteps and the roofs when it was
hot, and walking up and down the street when it
wasn't."
</p>

<p>
Violet remembered her own home, and reflected
that her excuse was less, because her surroundings
had been better.
</p>

<p>
"That must have been pretty bad," she said.
</p>

<p>
"It was bad, but it wasn't so bad as being indoors,
my dear.  That's what most girls think about it
anyway, and that's why they never go home before
ten or eleven.  How else do the moving-picture shows
keep running and how else do the dance-halls make
their cakes and ale?"
</p>

<p>
"The dance-halls?"  The word was new to Violet.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my dear, I said the dance-halls&mdash;where you
pay five cents to dance in the dust, with the windows
nailed fast to start a thirst, and then buy you bad
beer of the kind proprietor.  That's where the lodger
took this girl, and that's where she learned to drink."
</p>

<p>
"Too much?"
</p>

<p>
"Chuck it, dearie, chuck it.  Among all the wasters
I've known, I've never found one drunkard: they
all called themselves moderate drinkers.  Well, this
girlie played double for a bit, and then met a nice
young man that wanted to marry her next day.  She
woke up here."
</p>

<p>
"Did they drug her?"
</p>

<p>
"Did they drug you?  They don't have to drug
you: you know that.  The minute a girl tells me she
was drugged, I say to myself: 'You're the kind that
walk in and won't take "No" for an answer.'  No,
you catch flies with syrup; you don't shoot them with
machine-guns.  Narsty business, no?"
</p>

<p>
Violet was hearing for the first time how life made
the net in which it had taken her.  She passed her
hand across her burning eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have seen a lot," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Haven't I just?  I had my own little flat&mdash;to
myself, too&mdash;once upon a time, and I kept my eyes
about me.  There was the Dago woman that owned
a fruit-stand on my corner.  She lived in an alley
off Houston Street, and had a sixteen-year-old daughter
who worked twelve hours a day rolling cigarettes.&mdash;Chuck
me another, there's a good girlie.  Thanks,
awfully.&mdash;That girl hated her work&mdash;can you blame
her?&mdash;met a man that told her she wouldn't have to
work any more, and good-by."
</p>

<p>
"She went with him?"
</p>

<p>
"Parsed out of sight completely, my dear.
Mother nearly crazy.  Went to the police.  Police
added the girlie's name to their three columns of
other missing girls for that year, and said they
couldn't guess where she was.  An uncle tried to go
on an inspection-tour of his own, and had spent about
all the family cash when he got to a flat on West
Fortieth Street and had its girls in for the usual
drinks.  He saw his niece, but the bouncer knocked
him down, and when he woke up in the arey, the
happy family had moved."
</p>

<p>
"And that was all?"
</p>

<p>
"That was all till, some two years later, the girl
sent for her mother to come to Bellevue to see her
die.  As soon as she was used up, they'd turned her
out without one of the pennies she had earned for
them.&mdash;Narsty, eh?"
</p>

<p>
There was a brief pause.
</p>

<p>
"I guess," said Violet, "there ain't much chance
for you unless you're good."
</p>

<p>
"My dear," answered the Englishwoman, "if
you're good, you haven't a chance at all.  It's just
a question of whether you have or haven't enough to
live on.  The best guardian of a man's virtue is
the worst enemy of a woman's&mdash;and that's an empty
pocketbook, my dear."
</p>

<p>
But Violet was in no mind for generalizations.
</p>

<p>
"It's a business, then, ain't it?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"A regular business," nodded Evelyn,&mdash;"fifty
cents up&mdash;and now that they've smashed the lotteries,
policy, and the races, it's more of a business than
ever.  There are hundreds of young chaps all over
the country who make their living by selling girls
to places like this&mdash;and worse than this; and there
are more who make better livings by making one,
or two, or even three girls walk the street for them.
Just now, in New York, the street's the main thing."
</p>

<p>
"An' people like Miss Rose&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"They buy the girls and pay a percentage on their
work, my dear, till the debt's cleared.  Sometimes
they give their girls nothing but brass checks for
every job, but whether we get brass checks or real
cash, it's all the same: board and lodging and clothes
are so high that we never get out of debt to the
madam.  Trust her for that!"
</p>

<p>
She had a thorough knowledge of her subject,
and she ran on as if her only interest in it were
economic.  She talked of Denver, with its two-room
houses in which the front seemed one large window
where the sole inmate displayed her wares; of
Chicago with the curtained doors through which was
thrust only a hand to receive the varying price of
admission, even a quarter of a dollar occasionally
sufficing; of the same city's infamous club
maintained by politicians for their own debauches.  She
told of the proprietresses making a specialty of
"sending out" for girls that worked at other and
ill-paid tasks by day; of women conducting flats on
a partnership basis; of those who rented, for high
prices, houses that would otherwise be tenantless
because of poor conditions or the opening of some
street that must soon be cut through the premises.
She said that young girls unsoiled would sometimes
fetch their owners fifty dollars for their initial
destruction, but that, as a rule, the sums were relatively
small.
</p>

<p>
"And Miss Rose has to pay the police," asked
Violet; "don't she?"
</p>

<p>
"She does just, little innocent.  And the police
have to pay the officers above them, and the officers
above them have to pay the ward-bosses above
<i>them</i>&mdash;and there you are.  It's all the worse since the
bosses can't make any money from gambling-houses,
and it's all the worse since the business got
organized and meant votes for the gang at every
election.&mdash;Oh," Evelyn broke off&mdash;"I tell you it's the
same in every city the world over, my dear, and you
and I haven't even the comfort of being exceptions."
</p>

<p>
"Don't people know about it?"
</p>

<p>
"People don't want to know about it.  People
don't want to feel badly.  People say that it isn't
true, and that, if it is true, it isn't fit to mention."
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever go to a dance-hall?"
</p>

<p>
Forgetting her recent attitude of democracy,
Evelyn raised her pointed chin.
</p>

<p>
"I should say not," she answered.  "Only a year
ago I had that apartment of my very own.  An
Africander took me out of the chorus at the
'Gaiety' over home,&mdash;and a good job, too&mdash;and,
when he died and I came here, one of the best doctors
in this town took care of me.  He said he was going
to marry me," she ended with a short laugh, "but
when his old wife died, he forgot that, and forgot
me, and married a society girl young enough to be
his grandchild.  Of course he died himself after a
few months, but that didn't help me, my dear: I
had to strike out, and now, from the best places
I've come down as far as this."
</p>

<p>
Violet was still too young to feel keenly for
another while herself in suffering, a fact that must
have presented itself to Evelyn, because she turned
from her own story with an easy shrug.
</p>

<p>
"After all," she pursued, "the thing's at least
better run now that it has become a men's business.
There are no jobs left at the top except the running of
the houses: the men get the girls, the rents, and
most of the profits."
</p>

<p>
"Fritzie said they got lots of immigrants."
</p>

<p>
"Well, rather.  Most of the Dago ditch-diggers
go home every winter, and any one of them will bring
a girl back with him as his wife if you'll pay him
a little over the price of the passage money.  That's
one way, but there are a jolly lot more, not to
mention the make-believe employment agencies that catch
the girls by regiments.  The women are packed over
here in the steerage like cattle, my dear, and ticketed
like low-class freight.  All they own goes into a
small handbag and once they get here, they're herded
ten in a room till the agency-runners call for them.
Around Houston Street you can see streets full of
those nifty little agencies: they ship the girls all
over the States."
</p>

<p>
"I never thought such things could happen."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you didn't.  Nobody does, my dear&mdash;and
that's one reason they do happen.  Not that
the immigrants are unduly favored.  All over the
East Side you can see families of the Chosen People
going into real mourning for cadet-caught girlies,
just as if the poor things were really dead.  The
other races suffer quite as much, too, though the
Yankees are less likely to get into the cheaper joints."
</p>

<p>
"That's where they give them the brass checks?"
asked Violet.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  The man buys the checks downstairs, on
a commutation schedule, just the w'y we used to
buy our drink checks in a beer garden.  The girls
never see real money&mdash;except when they make a
touch, and then it's not any use&mdash;because they cash
in their checks to the madam, and she counts them
against what her young l'idies owe her.  Even at
that"&mdash;Evelyn nearly sat upright in her animation&mdash;"even
at that, they do s'y the men try to jew
you down as badly as they do here.  I've always
noticed that the honestest man that ever lived will
try to cheat a girl.  But you'll learn it all in time,
girlie.  I'm only sorry that you'll never see the better
plices."
</p>

<p>
Violet missed the innuendo, but she asked:
</p>

<p>
"Then there are better and worse?"
</p>

<p>
Evelyn laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Right-oh!" she said.  "The horrid truth is,
my dear, that we and Rose are hopelessly middle-class.
I wish you could see the better, and as for
the worse, wait till you live in a plice where there
are sliding panels in the wall, and men are robbed
every night."
</p>

<p>
If there had been any sympathy in the Englishwoman's
tone, Violet might have appealed to her for
whatever of real assistance she could give, but
Evelyn's scarcely interrupted monologue soon made it
clear that she had no help to offer.
</p>

<p>
"It's all rotten," she continued,&mdash;"all rotten
because it has to be.  Do you fancy that, if Rose
wasn't sure of us, she wouldn't have her ear at that
keyhole now?  She can call in Angel half the time,
and one cop or another's never far around the
corner.  Three weeks ago Phil Beekman, one of her
best customers, tried to balance a lamp on his nose
and broke it, and Riley was there to arrest him for
disorderly conduct before the boy could get to his
wallet.  He had to pay twenty-five dollars&mdash;half
went to Riley&mdash;for that fifteen-dollar lamp that
Rose had insured for eighteen.  We're all that w'y;
we all have to be spies on the rest.  I am, you soon
will be, and that little Wanda&mdash;well, of course,
Rose makes too much fuss over her."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" asked Violet.
</p>

<p>
But Evelyn only shook her towsled yellow head.
</p>

<p>
"I mean, my dear," she said, "that there are
some things, you know, that even I don't fancy
discussing."
</p>

<p>
"She was an immigrant, wasn't she?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," Evelyn acquiesced, with a yawn.  Already
her restless heart was tiring of the conversation
and her insistent thirst was crying for more
alcohol.  "Wanda came over here to be a housemaid.
She landed in Philadelphia and went directly
to an employment agency, like a good girlie.  They
took her money for their commission in getting her
a job, and then they sold her right over here to a
sailors' joint."
</p>

<p>
"For housework?"
</p>

<p>
"Housework?  My dear, you overact your part.
There's no housework done in those plices; but
Wanda's won her w'y up in the world.  Here she
is at Rose's, if you please, though by what sort of
housework I shan't tell you."
</p>

<p>
"I wish&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not another word, my dear.  Talking is a dry
game.  After all, drinking is the king of indoor
sports.  Come on down and rig a bit of fizz."
</p>

<p>
But Violet did not join in this predatory expedition.
She forgot the plight of the new captive whose
cries she had heard; she forgot even the details of
Evelyn's just-related case; she remembered only so
much of the general situation, now made clear to
her, as bore upon her own position, and she came at
last to a pitch of crafty courage that was far more
promising of success than any of the hysterical
determinations that she had previously experienced.  Open
revolt was futile; she would employ methods more
circuitous, and would use whatever weapons were at
hand.
</p>

<p>
It was, as Evelyn had said, a house of spies and
eavesdroppers, and, at the next opportunity&mdash;which
occurred that night&mdash;Violet sought again her secret
place of vantage on the back stairs, and listened again
to her jailer in conversation with the Italian.  Her
time, as it chanced, was brief, but she heard enough
to know that Wesley Dyker was the subject of the
conference, and that betrayal of some sort was its
intent.
</p>

<p>
"Nothin' much," Rose was saying, in apparent
answer to some question asked before the spy had
taken up her breathless post in the darkened
stairway.  "I'll get more out of him later on."
</p>

<p>
"Yas," replied Angel, "but how mooch?"
</p>

<p>
"He said he thought he'd pull it off, all right,
but wasn't sure of O'Malley.  Said he'd got a bunch
of kind words from up top, but was scared for fear
O'Malley would knife him.  He's a pretty wise guy
for all he's a swell, and he's lookin' out for the
double-cross from your crowd."
</p>

<p>
"He ast you to helpa keepa lookout?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure he did.  Said if O'Malley's man put up
a bluff at runnin' independent, I was to tip him off
when O'Malley began registering votes here."
</p>

<p>
"That isa good.  More?"
</p>

<p>
"Some.  Said he wanted me to keep my ears wide
for any news.  Wanted me to pump you."
</p>

<p>
"He deed?"  The voice grew threatening.  "Say,
now, you tella me why he knaw you knawa me?"
</p>

<p>
"I guess he has as good ears as most people."
</p>

<p>
"But how he knawa me an' you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He don't know that, Angel.  Keep your hair on.
He don't know nothin' about it.  If he did, do you
think he'd stand for it, an' cough up all these here
straight tips to me?"
</p>

<p>
"Na-aw," the Italian drawlingly admitted, in slow
mollification.  "Naw, maybe he woulda not."
</p>

<p>
"He certainly wouldn't.  He don't know nothin'
about it.  What he's afraid of is that somebody
might think <i>he</i> stood in too good here."
</p>

<p>
"He say that?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep."
</p>

<p>
"Alla right.  Now, you tella him when he comes
again, O'Malley means&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The voice dropped to so low a whisper that Violet
could hear no more, and, before it was raised, the
doorbell had sounded and she had heard Celeste,
upstairs, calling her.  She tiptoed back to the upper
hallway.
</p>

<p>
"Cassie say you' New York Central frien' ees
askin' for you," volunteered the French girl as they
met.
</p>

<p>
"All right," answered Violet.  "I'll be right
down.  I was trying to swipe a bottle.  And say,
Celeste, how does that Wesley Dyker come to have
such a pull with Miss Rose?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh-h!  You don' know?  That Wes' Dyk' 'e
mabby be a magistrate nex' 'lection.  'E's one gran'
man now for bail an' lawyer when trouble come.&mdash;'Es's
frien's with so many politicians, too.  But Meess
Rose, she know 'e will be some more eef 'e be 'lected
magistrate."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see.  But doesn't she keep standing in, on
the quiet, with the other people who want the place,
too?"
</p>

<p>
Celeste nodded a cheerful agreement.
</p>

<p>
"But of a certainty," she said.  "Meess Rose, she
know 'er beezness.  Whoever get that 'lection, Meess
Rose, she will 'ave been 'ees frien'."
</p>

<p>
Violet asked no more.  She had learned enough to
put into her hands the best weapon just then available.

<br><br>
ON STRIKE
</h3>

<p>
Katie Flanagan arrived at the Lennox
department-store every morning at a
quarter to eight o'clock.  She passed through
the employés' dark entrance, a unit in a horde of
other workers, and registered the instant of her
arrival on a time-machine that could in no wise be
suborned to perjury.  She hung up her wraps in a
subterranean cloak-room, and, hurrying to the counter
to which she was assigned, first helped in "laying
out the stock," and then stood behind her wares,
exhibiting, cajoling, selling, until an hour before
noon.  At that time she was permitted to run away
for exactly forty-five minutes for the glass of milk
and two pieces of bread and jam that composed her
luncheon.  This repast disposed of, she returned to
the counter and remained behind it, standing like a
war-worn watcher on the ramparts of a beleaguered
city, till the store closed at six, when there remained
to her at least fifteen minutes more of work before
her sales-book was balanced and the wares covered
up for the night.  There were times indeed when she
did not leave the store until seven o'clock, but those
times were caused rather by customers than by the
management of the store, which could prevent new
shoppers from entering the doors after six, but could
hardly turn out those already inside.
</p>

<p>
The automatic time-machine and a score of more
annoying, and equally automatic, human beings, kept
watch upon all that she did.  The former, in addition
to the floor-walker in her section of the store,
recorded her every going and coming, the latter
reported every movement not prescribed by the
regulations of the establishment; and the result upon Katie
and her fellow-workers was much the result observable
upon condemned assassins under the unwinking
surveillance of the Death Watch.
</p>

<p>
If Katie was late, she was fined ten cents for each
offense.  She was reprimanded if her portion of the
counter was disordered after a mauling by careless
customers.  She was fined for all mistakes she made
in the matter of prices and the additions on her
sales-book; and she was fined if, having asked the
floor-walker for three or five minutes to leave the floor
in order to tidy her hair and hands, in constant need
of attention through the rapidity of her work and
the handling of her dyed wares, she exceeded her
time limit by so much as a few seconds.
</p>

<p>
There were no seats behind the counters, and
Katie, whatever her physical condition, remained on
her feet all day long unless she could arrange for
relief by a fellow-worker during that worker's
luncheon time.  There was no place for rest save a damp,
ill-lighted "Recreation Room" in the basement,
furnished with a piano that nobody had time to play,
magazines that nobody had time to read, and wicker
chairs in which nobody had time to sit.  All that one
might do was to serve the whims and accept the
scoldings of women customers who knew too ill, or
too well, what they wanted to buy; keep a tight rein
upon one's indignation at strolling men who did not
intend to buy anything that the shop advertised; be
servilely smiling under the innuendoes of the
high-collared floor-walkers, in order to escape their wrath;
maintain a sharp outlook for the "spotters," or paid
spies of the establishment; thwart, if possible, those
pretending purchasers who were scouts sent from
other stores, and watch for shop-lifters on the one
hand and the firm's detectives on the other.
</p>

<p>
"It ain't a cinch, by no means"&mdash;thus ran the
departing Cora Costigan's advice to her successor&mdash;"but
it ain't nothin' now to what it will be in the
holidays.  I'd rather be dead than work in the
toy-department in December&mdash;I wonder if the kids guess
how we that sells 'em hates the sight of their
playthings&mdash;and I'd rather be dead <i>an'</i> damned than work
in the accounting-department.  A girl friend of mine
worked there last year,&mdash;only it was over to
Malcare's store&mdash;an' didn't get through her Christmas
Eve work till two on Christmas morning, an' she
lived over on Staten Island.  She overslept on the
twenty-sixth, an' they docked her a half-week's pay.
</p>

<p>
"An' don't never," concluded Cora, "don't never
let 'em transfer you to the exchange department.
The people that exchange things all belong in the
psychopathic ward at Bellevue&mdash;them that don't
belong in Sing Sing.  Half the goods they bring back
have been used for days, an' when the store ties a
tag on a sent-on-approval opera cloak, the women
wriggle the tag inside, an' wear it to the theater with
a scarf draped over the string.  Thank God, I'm
goin' to be married!"
</p>

<p>
In these conditions Katie found many imperative
duties, but none quite so immediately imperative as
the repression of Mr. Porter.  She had not made
her first sale at the main women's hosiery counter
on the first floor, to which she had been assigned
on her arrival&mdash;pretty girls always being favored
with first-floor positions&mdash;when that tall, gray-whiskered
gentleman, his duties in his underground office
not at this hour holding him, majestically approached
her.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Miss Flanagan," he said, with a
beneficent smile, as he placed his white hand upon
her quailing shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Katie became very busy with the stock that was
new to her.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Mr. Porter," she answered.&mdash;"Say,
Miss Isaacs, how much do these lisle ones
sell at?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought," said Mr. Porter, fixing her with his
apparently emotionless gaze, "that I would just
come over and see if you were well taken care of."
</p>

<p>
"None better, Mr. Porter."  Katie smiled sweetly
as she said it, and still more sweetly as she
significantly added: "Them's always taken good care of
as are used to takin' good care of themselves."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Porter blinked, but his expression, or lack of
expression, did not alter.
</p>

<p>
"No doubt," he responded, as he reluctantly made
ready to go away; "but I shall be glad to be of help
at any time I can."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Mr. Porter."
</p>

<p>
"And I shall drop around now and then to see
that all goes well."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Mr. Porter."
</p>

<p>
"Because I was always interested in Miss
Costigan&mdash;very much interested, and she was very
pleasant to me&mdash;and I am naturally very much interested
in her successor, too."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Mr. Porter."
</p>

<p>
"And, by the way, Miss Flanagan," he added as
his Parthian shaft, "I trust you won't worry over
that little loan, you know; there's no hurry in the
world about repayment."
</p>

<p>
Katie met his vacant glance with the innocent eyes
of a grateful child.
</p>

<p>
"That's kind you are, Mr. Porter," she answered,
"and since you say it, I shan't worry, sir."
</p>

<p>
But for all that, she did not by any means dismiss
the man from her thoughts.  Her true schooling
had been received from the textbook of life, and she
had readily observed in Porter's demeanor the tokens
that announced the beginning of a chase.  To one
class of hunters there is no closed season, and Katie
knew that this class considered her and her kind fair
game.
</p>

<p>
There had been occasions when she had debated
seriously, sometimes with herself and sometimes with
a companion, whether it was worth while to continue
the flight, whether from three to six years of
captivity, of toil that must end in death, but that was
at least assured of food, were not to be preferred
to the continuance of a precarious dodging through
the industrial forest with the possibility of starvation
lurking behind every bush.  But this question
she had always, thus far, answered in the negative,
at first because of her inherent disinclination to
confess defeat in any struggle that engaged her, and
at last because of Hermann Hoffmann.
</p>

<p>
To Katie's cheerful cynicism that blind optimist
was an object of unfailing tenderness.  She knew how
he had been left, when his father's heart was broken
after a long battle against an oppressive landlord
system, with a gentle mother whom he worshiped
and who thus became entirely dependent upon him;
how he had sold the few remaining family belongings,
escaped the threat of a compulsory military
service that would have left Frau Hoffmann in
destitution, and come, lured by the glittering promises
of one of the immigration agents of a steamship
company, to the land where he had been told there
existed equality of opportunity for all men.  And he
had told Katie, in his convincingly simple English,
how, a shred at a time, the fabric of his ideal had
been torn away; how bitterly he had toiled only to
keep his foothold; how the little mother had fallen
beneath the stress, and yet how, to the last, he still
retained his high hope, and still dreamed of a genuine
democracy in a country where the men that worked
would eventually become the owners of the wealth
that their hands created.
</p>

<p>
She was thinking of this when, that night, she
returned to her tenement and found waiting at her
door her neighbor Carrie Berkowicz, the shirt-waist
worker, who had told her of the chance of a position
at the Lennox shop.
</p>

<p>
"Hello," said Katie.  "Lookin' for me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Come on in."
</p>

<p>
Katie led the way and lit the lamp, which threw
a kindly light over the neat, bare room, with its
stiff wooden chairs, its oilcloth-covered table, and
the lithograph of Our Lady of the Rosary tacked
against the room door.  A gas-stove, a cot, a bureau,
and a screened-off sink completed the furnishings.
</p>

<p>
"I'm just gettin' a bite of supper," she said, before
she asked the cause of Carrie's visit.  "You'd
better have some."
</p>

<p>
"No, thank you," replied the caller, with her
careful night-school inflection.  "I had mine early."
</p>

<p>
Katie looked at the speaker, whose round cheeks
seemed drawn in a new determination, and whose jaw
was swollen as if from a blow.
</p>

<p>
"How did you get through so early, Carrie?"
she inquired.
</p>

<p>
The little Lithuanian's eyes sparkled.
</p>

<p>
"We've done it," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Done what?"
</p>

<p>
"Gone out."
</p>

<p>
"Struck?"
</p>

<p>
Carrie nodded.
</p>

<p>
"You know how it was," she explained; "all the
girls around here do.  We've had to work all day
long from early morning till late night, Sundays too,
and five dollars for the seven days is counted pretty
good wages."
</p>

<p>
"But somebody said the firms' books showed your
pay was higher."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the books did show it.  You see, they carry
only a few of us on their salary list, and then each
of the foremen hires helpers paid out of one girl's
wages.  You know as well as I do that most of us
live on oatmeal and crackers, and rent one bed in
somebody else's tenement."
</p>

<p>
Katie was acquainted with enough of the shirt-waist
makers to be aware that this was true.
</p>

<p>
"That's so," she granted; "only I thought them
things were all ended after the last row."
</p>

<p>
"Well, they weren't ended; they were only helped
for a few months, and now it's summer and most of
us would have been laid off.  It's the worst time to
strike&mdash;we know that&mdash;but things came to a point
where we had to make a fight, or there wouldn't
have been any of us left to fight when a better time
did come."
</p>

<p>
"You're talkin' about the union?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's the real point.  The bosses started
a union of their own."
</p>

<p>
"Among themselves?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;they've always had that.  I mean they
got the new girls into what they called a beneficial
association, with the bosses for officers.  If you join
that, you get all sorts of favors, but you can't join
unless you leave the old union."
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, as soon as they get the beneficial
association full enough, they discharge the union
girls and, little by little, withdraw the privileges
from the Association members, so that things go
back to where they were before."
</p>

<p>
The girl spoke quietly, but Katie remembered
many of the evils that Carrie had not mentioned.
She recalled how each moment's pause in work
meant a deduction from the worker's pay; how the
elaborate system of fines taxed the girl whose fingers
left her task to rearrange a straying lock of hair,
and how the tears forced by overstrained nerves or
over-exerted muscles cost the offender almost a fixed
price apiece; how the girls that did piecework
received no money unless they brought the little check
for every article made, the firm thereby saving,
through the inevitable loss of some of these checks,
a proportion of payment as well known to them and
as certain as the mortality rates of life insurance.
</p>

<p>
"An' so you went out, Carrie?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; they turned down our committee at three
o'clock this afternoon, and at three-fifteen we had
all left the shops.  Oh, it was great!  But they've
got a lot of hands left, and they'll have some of their
orders filled in Newark.  I don't know how it will
end."
</p>

<p>
"The bosses wouldn't budge?"
</p>

<p>
"Not an inch.  The most they did was to get
some of us aside, each away from the rest, and offer
us seven dollars a week apiece if we'd fix things up
so that our friends would go back to work without
any more trouble."
</p>

<p>
Katie, who well knew what seven dollars a week
must mean to this calm, hardworking Lithuanian
girl, who had come to America alone and was
saving to send her parents money enough to follow,
shot a sidelong glance at the speaker; but Carrie's
tone had not changed; she seemed unaware that she
was narrating anything unusual.
</p>

<p>
"An' you turned down the offer?" asked Katie.
</p>

<p>
"Last strike," said Carrie, "one of those union
girls was sent out to sell copies of a special edition
of <i>The Call</i> for the benefit of the strikers.  She
hadn't had anything to eat for three days.  One man
gave her a five-dollar bill for a single paper.
Nobody saw him give it; she didn't have to account for
it; and she was nearly starved; but she came back
and turned in that whole five dollars to the fund.
That was one of the girls I was representing this
afternoon.  Do you suppose I could go back on such
girls?  Do you suppose I could help myself when
I knew it was hurting the others?"
</p>

<p>
Katie did not immediately reply, but her blue eyes
shone.  Presently she asked:
</p>

<p>
"Picket-duty, now, for yours?"
</p>

<p>
"I began it right away.  I spoke to one scab as
she came out&mdash;just asked her wouldn't she join the
union for her own good and ours&mdash;just laid my hand
on her wrist&mdash;but they had the cops ready and their
own strong-arm men, and had three of them beating
me for my pains."
</p>

<p>
"Pinched?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  The magistrate let me off with
a lecture on the rights of every girl to work for
starvation-wages if she felt like doing it and like making
others starve.&mdash;But next time it will be a fine or
the workhouse."
</p>

<p>
Katie had begun to busy herself with the preparations
for her meal.  She had warmed some coffee on
the gas-stove and taken from the cupboard a roll and
a few slices of dried beef.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," she said, stopping in the midst of
this task; "how much money have you got?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm all right, thanks."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe you are, but you might as well be better.
Now, the while the strike lasts, just you give up
that room acrost the hall an' come over here with
me."
</p>

<p>
Carrie's brown locks shook in doubtful refusal.
</p>

<p>
"You're the real goods," she said; "but I don't
have to do that."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you don't have to, but I'd take it a
real kindness.  What's the use o' keepin' a whole
room to yourself when you'll be spendin' parts of
the time in jail?"
</p>

<p>
Carrie laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Will you let me pay half?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Sure I will."
</p>

<p>
"Then perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That's settled," ended Katie, and it was arranged
that Carrie's few sticks of furniture should
be moved into the Irish girl's quarters the next
morning.
</p>

<p>
The details had just been settled when Hermann
entered, his cheerful lips concluding the last bar of
"Die Wacht Am Rhein."
</p>

<p>
"Hello!" said Katie, smiling.  "Are you out
of a job, too?  Or are you just goin' to be late the
night?"
</p>

<p>
Hermann pulled his cap from his blonde curls and,
with blushing cheeks, grinned broadly.
</p>

<p>
"Needer," he answered.  "I'm chust on my vay
to de saloon."  He twisted his cap between his
awkward fingers.  "I vanted only to ask you somesing,
Katie."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Sit down an' ask it.  You know Carrie.
Don't mind her."
</p>

<p>
"Sure I know her, only&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Carrie rose.  She was aware of the pair's relations,
and too firmly bound by East Side etiquette to think
it well to make of herself that third person who
constitutes a crowd.
</p>

<p>
"I've got to be going," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you pay no attention to him," Katie objected.
"Sit still.  Have some coffee, Hermann-boy?"
</p>

<p>
But Hermann shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"No, thank you," he said.  "I've got chust a
minute."
</p>

<p>
"Then what was it you were wishin' to say?"
</p>

<p>
"Aboud dot girl I dalked to you aboud on our
vay to Coney.  You see now you have a tshob, it
seemed like ve might do somesing for her."
</p>

<p>
Katie dropped all trace of banter.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you how it is, Hermann," she said, and
she did tell him.
</p>

<p>
As soon as she had secured her place, she had
determined to help.  At present much financial
assistance was impossible, and employment there was
none.  It would be dangerous, moreover, to all
concerned&mdash;not least of all to Violet&mdash;for the girl to
make a dash for liberty in any manner that would
give to Rose a chance to secure vengeance through
her friends the police.  But Katie was decided, and
Carrie at once agreed, that, could the escape be
arranged, Violet might at least be sheltered in Katie's
room until some work should be found for her.
</p>

<p>
"All I want to know, Hermann-boy," concluded
Katie, "is however in the world we're goin' to get
word to her."
</p>

<p>
"Dot's chust vat I vanted fer to tell you aboud,"
said Hermann.  "You know Conrad Schultz.  He's
now got my route vith de brewery-vagon.  De
stable's chust two doors round de corner.  I've
explained to him, und he'll slip a note to Miss Violet
the first dime he sees her."
</p>

<p>
"We'll write to-night," said Carrie.
</p>

<p>
"An' I'll hand it to him on my way to work in
th' mornin'," added Katie.  "Now you run along or
you'll be docked."
</p>

<p>
Hermann assented, smiling.  He turned to the
door, fumbled with the knob, and dropped his cap.
Katie, a steaming cup of coffee in one hand, stooped
to recover it just as Hermann himself bent forward.
In the presence of a third person, the German felt
a sudden thrill of courage.
</p>

<p>
"Ach, but you're a goot girl, Katie!" he cried.
"Und here's a liddle revard fer it!"
</p>

<p>
He seized his cap, jerked her black head toward
him, and imprinted a resounding kiss on her pink
cheek.
</p>

<p>
Katie laughed and broke free.  She spilled some
of the coffee, but she administered a smart blow with
her open palm on the offending mouth.
</p>

<p>
"You'd never dared to do it if you hadn't thought
I had me hands full!" she called after her lover as
he clattered heavily and happily down the stairs.
"An' just in revenge for that," she added, still
blushing, to Carrie, as she closed the door, "me an'
you'll go out for a little spree of our own to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Where to?" asked the factory-girl.
</p>

<p>
"To a dance," answered Katie.  "Me feet have
got that lazy walkin' after a job that I'm afraid
they'll forget all the dancin'-steps they ever knew,
unless I hurry an' get some practicin' again."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Carrie, doubtfully, "I've
got to get up early in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"An' what about me?  Besides, haven't I got
me friend, the alarm-clock?"
</p>

<p>
"But my jaw's smashed from that fight."
</p>

<p>
"Who'll see it?"
</p>

<p>
"Let's make it a moving-picture show."
</p>

<p>
"An' pay the same for half an hour's headache
that we could get a whole night's dancin' for?"
</p>

<p>
"I've got to be walking the picket-line all day
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, an' I have to be standin' behind a counter.
You haven't got nothin' on me there.  Get your
wraps together now an' come ahead, Carrie.  I hear
there's a new place opened on Grand Street."
</p>

<p>
Carrie knew how to dance&mdash;the poorest girl on
the East Side knows that, because not to dance is to
miss the one amusement obtainable by the very
poor&mdash;and, like Katie, she was of that relatively small
army that can frequent the dance-halls for perhaps
as much as a year without contamination.  Before
she had taken her course at the night-school, she had
even danced in the rooms that the Hebrew politicians
provide behind their saloons near Houston Street,
where she had seen cadets successfully ply their trade
among bland-faced immigrant girls whose very language
was unknown to them; and she was therefore
wholly prepared for the picture that she confronted
when, Katie having paid her ten cents for the two
admissions, they entered the low-ceilinged basement
of a saloon and tenement-house, and came upon
the meeting-place of the Danny Delancy Social
Club.
</p>

<p>
Through a veil of dust raised by stamping feet
and swirling skirts, through a cloud of heat from
a room with every window closed, through a blast
of odors compounded of the fumes of alcohol, the
scent of tobacco, and the miasma of sweating men
and women, there rose, from somewhere, the cries of
a beaten piano, struck and thumped into a shrieking
likeness to the "Chocolate Soldier" waltz, which
only now and then was made at all audible above
the rhythmic hubbub.  Although the evenings of
Saturdays and Sundays were the most popular for
dancing, the floor was so crowded that only the
expertness of these trained dancers prevented
collision and panic.  The steam from the bodies of the
performers joined with the dry dust in half obscuring
the blue-burning gas.  The strident laughter of
the patrons helped the scraping of their feet in
subduing the sounds of the piano.  The men gyrated
grimly in wet shirt-sleeves, and the women, affecting
the most somber shades chosen for the longest wear,
spun in their partners' arms with stolid, gum-grinding
jaws and lips that were mirthless.  Except for
the youthful "spielers" admitted without charge,
or even hired, to dance with the awkward or make
wall-flowers sufficiently happy to insure their return,
there were but two types of men among the patrons.
There was the native of the quarter, heavy-faced,
large-muscled, quick to anger and ready with the
fists, a hard-drinking, hard-living sort, no more
careful of his neighbor's morals than of his own, yet
good-natured, easy-going, pliable.  And winding in
and out among these, slow and suave, like some sleek
species of vulture, were the young men that came
there not for pleasure, but for profit, always-smiling
young men with manners offensively elaborate, whose
shining black hair smelled of oil, whose skin was
like decaying dough, and whose entire time was spent
in making the acquaintance of new girls, giving
dancing-lessons to new girls in crowded corners, and
taking new girls into the adjoining back-bar for a
drink.
</p>

<p>
To these types the attending women more or less
corresponded.  Most of them came alone, or in
groups of two or three&mdash;a plain girl always
befriended by one of more charm&mdash;because etiquette
demanded that, if a man brought a companion, his
companion must give him what dances he wanted,
and so she would have few offers from his fellows,
who observed a rigid code that forbade poaching
upon a friend's preserve.  There were some that
could afford to wear gay dresses because they were
frankly in a business that, of however brief
duration, made gay dresses possible as a luxury and
necessary as an advertisement, and this appearance of
wealth was never absent from the hungry eyes of
the young women about them.  There were others,
also few, who were plainly new either to the country
or to this particular form of amusement.  But the
majority came from the factories and shops, lured
by nothing worse than youth's natural craving for
its right to pleasure, seeking to forget the exertions
of the day in these new exertions of the night,
drifting whither they neither knew nor greatly cared,
the necessary factors of an industrial system too
fatuous to conserve their efficiency.
</p>

<p>
On every chair along the reeking walls, now trodden
underfoot on the floor, and now picked up like
dry leaves and twirled about in the little eddies of
warm air created by the romping dancers, were cards
and handbills&mdash;"throwaways" the patrons called
them&mdash;which, often in curious English, announced
special balls and "grand receptions" shortly to be
given in this or some similar club.  Here one was
"cordially invited" to the "third annual dance
given by the two well-known friends, Greaser Einstein
and Kid Boslair, at New Starlight Hall, Gents
Twenty-five and Ladies Fifteen"; there one was
cautioned not to miss the "Devil Dance" that would
form a part of the forthcoming "reception of the
Harry Cronin Association, Young Theo, floor-manager";
and again, one was told that the "Special
Extra Event of the Season" would be the ball of
the "Ryan McCall Social, Incorporated, Tammany
Hall, ticket admit gent including wardrobe,
Thirty-five cents; ladies free."
</p>

<p>
Katie and the shirtwaist-maker got seats near the
door, waved and called to half a dozen acquaintances
and strained their eyes to see through the swirling
mist.
</p>

<p>
"It looks like old times," said Carrie.
</p>

<p>
"Smells like 'em," Katie amended; "only I've
been away from these places for awhile an' I notice
that, new place or old, the faces change pretty quick.
Who's the woman in red, with the yellow hair, Carrie?"
</p>

<p>
She pointed to a figure spinning about the center
of the room, her crimson skirt flying far behind her
like the trail of a comet.
</p>

<p>
"I know her," said Carrie.  "A year ago she
came to New York from the country to find work.
When she was about starved, she rang a bell under
the sign 'Helping Hand Home'&mdash;she didn't know
what that meant except that it meant charity.  The
superintendent told her his place couldn't do
anything for her; she might be spoiled by associating
with the people he helped; his mission was for bad
women that were sorry; not for good women that
hadn't anything to be sorry about.  'But I'm hungry,'
she told him.  'Can't help it,' he said; 'you're
not qualified.'  This girl went away, and came back
a month later.  'I don't want to come in just yet,'
she said; 'but I do want to tell you that I'm qualified
now'&mdash;and she was."
</p>

<p>
Katie took the facts for what, amid surroundings
where such facts are plentiful, they seemed worth.
</p>

<p>
"Hard luck," she said, though not without meaning.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and look at her clothes."
</p>

<p>
"That's the trouble," said Katie; "we can't help
lookin' at them&mdash;the likes of us&mdash;any more than she
can help wearin' them.  It's that or a tenement
with two dark rooms an' the rent raised every
year."
</p>

<p>
They danced, for among the soberer men there
were many that knew them, and neither girl remembered
the weariness of her work in the exhaustion of
her dancing.  Between dances, in the dressing-room,
they talked with their acquaintances among the girls,
gossiping of the men and the other women, and now
and then, their throats dry and their faces streaming,
they were taken into the dingy side-bar and were
bought a glass of beer.
</p>

<p>
As midnight drew closer the dance became more
stormy.  Many of the working-girls went home, and
their places were filled by women of the brighter
dressed class.  There were some that were plainly
drunk, and these clumsily imitated the suggestive
contortions of the salaried dancers now sent upon
the floor to stimulate the amateurs.  One girl, in a
cleared space surrounded by laughing men and
envious, though apparently scornful, women,
performed a dance popularly supposed to be forbidden
by the police.  There were several fights, and in one
especially nasty scuffle a lad was badly cut by the
knife of a jealous partner.
</p>

<p>
"I guess that's about plenty for us," observed
Katie, as she and Carrie shouldered their way from
the crowd surrounding the wounded boy and his
shrieking assailant.
</p>

<p>
Both girls were sufficiently familiar with such
episodes to accept them with calm, but both were at
last tired out.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you're right," Carrie assented,
"though I did have a good time."
</p>

<p>
"An' it was you didn't want to come!"
grinned Katie as they went out upon the cool
street.
</p>

<p>
"I know."  Carrie's round face grew hard and
puzzled.  "I know," she admitted, "only sometimes&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Och, come on, an' cheer up!  We must write
our letter for the brewery-man before we get to bed,
Carrie-girl."
</p>

<p>
They did write it, but Carrie, when she had gone
into her own room for the last night she was to spend
there, sat for some time motionless upon the edge
of the cot.
</p>

<p>
"I know," she repeated as if to some invisible
confessor; "I know both sides of it, and, honestly,
I don't know which is worse.  I know all that can
be said, only&mdash;sometimes&mdash;I wonder&mdash;&mdash;"

XIII
<br><br>
JAIL-DELIVERY
</h3>

<p>
Rose was ill&mdash;she had been drinking too much
for the past week&mdash;and Violet, in her no
longer fresh red kimona, was in the kitchen
talking to Cassie when, one morning, the new driver
of the brewery-wagon stopped at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Morning," he said with what at once struck
Violet, who was now constantly on the watch, as a
visible effort at nonchalance.
</p>

<p>
Conrad Schultz was a tall, raw-boned German-American,
with a long nose and pale, sorrowful mustache,
but with an eye in the cerulean depths of
which there lurked the cold fire of reliable strategy.
</p>

<p>
"Come in," said Violet, "an' have a drop of
something."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks."
</p>

<p>
He came in cumbersomely, and took an uneasy seat.
</p>

<p>
"Some chilly for this season," he remarked, with
a cool glance in the direction of the ebony Cassie,
hovering glumly in the background.
</p>

<p>
Violet thought she caught the meaning of the man,
whom she knew was Hermann Hoffmann's successor.
</p>

<p>
"It is chilly for this time of year," she said.
"What will you have?  It better be something warming.
There's whiskey here, or, if you don't mind
waiting till Cassie goes for it, there's some good
brandy in the cellar."
</p>

<p>
Schultz appeared to hesitate, and Violet, watching
him, could not, for a moment, decide whether there
was, after all, any foundation for the hope that his
appearance had wakened.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if it ain't no trouble," he at last blurted,
"I would like a taste of real brandy."
</p>

<p>
"Cassie," said Violet, "bring up a fresh bottle
of brandy for Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Schultz," prompted that individual.
</p>

<p>
"For Mr. Schultz, Cassie."
</p>

<p>
Cassie, however, seemed to have scented surrounding
mystery.
</p>

<p>
"Ah reckon there's a bottle som'ares about yhere,
Miss Vi'let," she demurred.
</p>

<p>
"No, there isn't."
</p>

<p>
"But, Miss Vi'let, there was one jes' half empty
las' night."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Rose took that to bed with her.  Don't
talk so much.  Go down an' get a fresh bottle for
Mr. Schultz."
</p>

<p>
The girl left the room slowly and sullenly.
</p>

<p>
Schultz sat silent and motionless until a moment
had followed the closing of the door.  Then the
cold flame was relighted in his eye.
</p>

<p>
"She called you Miss Violet?" he asked, though
still in the most commonplace of tones.
</p>

<p>
"That's my name."
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever talk to the man that had my job
before I had it?"
</p>

<p>
Violet, with the catlike quiet and ease that always
characterized her movements, stepped to the door
through which Cassie had just passed.  She flung it
quickly open.  The black girl nearly fell headlong
into the room.
</p>

<p>
Without an instant's hesitation, Violet did the one
effective thing.  She smacked the negress smartly
across the face.
</p>

<p>
"I heard you!" she said, in tones that were all
the more awe-inspiring because they were low.
"What do you mean by spying on me, you black
devil?  Think I want to cheat the house?  I'd not
be so clumsy about it, if I did!  Think I'm trying
to skidoo?  I'd walk out if I felt like it!  I'll go
right to Miss Rose about this, an' have you
fired so quick you won't have time to pack your
duds!"
</p>

<p>
The servant remained as she had sprawled.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please don', miss!" she wailed.  "Please
don' tell Miss Rose!  Ah wasn't tryin' to spy on
youse.  Ah jes' drapped somethin' yhere, an' ah was
jes' tryin' to fin'&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you lie to me," said Violet, her cheeks,
now always so wan in the morning light, flushing
to something like their former color.  "Get up off
your knees."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Vi'let, please don' tell on me."
</p>

<p>
The black girl's voice threatened to rise to a
dangerous wail.
</p>

<p>
"All right," said Violet, quickly.  "I'll let it go
this time; but you hurry up and get that brandy, or
I might change my mind.  Pull the cork while you're
at it, and fetch a decent glass from the dining-room."
</p>

<p>
Cassie, murmuring thanks with her thick lips, and
wiping her eyes with the big knuckles of her right
fist, scrambled to her feet, and started again upon
her errand.
</p>

<p>
This time Violet left the door open.  She waited
till the servant was out of earshot.  Then she opened
the door to the back stairway, which she herself
had twice used to excellent purpose, and, finding
nobody there, returned to Schultz.
</p>

<p>
"Got something for me?" she whispered.
</p>

<p>
But no haste upon her part would speed his
Teutonic caution.
</p>

<p>
"I asked you," he said, as if he had not observed
the little encounter through which he had sat serene
and unconcerned, "whether you knew the man who
had my job before what I had it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes, I knew him.  Quick!"
</p>

<p>
"And your name is Miss Violet?"
</p>

<p>
"You heard the girl call me that.  Can't you
hustle?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to hustle.  If you're the girl I
want, you've kept me waitin' here three mornings
already."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm the person all right.  You know that
now.  Oh, won't you please hurry?  Don't you see
how things are here?"
</p>

<p>
"I seen enough to make me want to go slow."
</p>

<p>
"You're going slow all right.  What more do
you want to know?  I talked to the man you're telling
me about and he said he'd see what he could do."
</p>

<p>
Her replies came with the rapidity of musketry,
but Schultz spoke with stubborn deliberation.
</p>

<p>
"Was that all he told you?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure it was."
</p>

<p>
"Nothin' more?"
</p>

<p>
"No.&mdash;Can't you hurry?  Can't you believe me?&mdash;He
didn't say no more.&mdash;Quick!&mdash;Oh, yes, he
said he'd talk to his girl Katie about
me.&mdash;Quick!&mdash;Hush-t!  Here she comes!"
</p>

<p>
Cassie's step sounded only a few yards away, but
Schultz, now apparently satisfied of Violet's identity,
displayed an unlooked for speed.  The heavy hand
that had been clumsily reposing in the bulging side-pocket
of his coat shot free.  Violet seized a fist that
opened and withdrew as her own fingers closed on
a bit of paper.
</p>

<p>
Cassie entered to find them the width of the
kitchen apart.  Violet was pouring herself a drink
of whiskey into a soiled glass, and, if her hand
trembled, the silk swathed back that was presented
to the servant hid all tokens of nervousness.
</p>

<p>
She waited until Schultz had slowly drunk his
brandy.  She waited to exchange a few more words
and to see him go.  She even waited a little longer in
order not to make her retreat too patently hurried
and in order to subdue by threats and cajolery whatever
suspicions might still be lingering in the black
breast of the apparently penitent Cassie.  But at last
she made her way to her own room and unrolled the
bit of paper.
</p>

<p>
It was a letter dated from Katie's address four
days previous to the day of its receipt, and it was
couched in stiff and formal phraseology.  She read:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"Miss VIOLET,
</p>

<p class="letter">
"<i>Dear Miss Violet&mdash;</i>
</p>

<p class="letter">
"This is to inform you that I am Miss Katie Flanagan,
particular friend of Mr. Hermann Hoffmann, who used to drive
the brewery-wagon that left beer at your house.  He told me
about you and what you want, and I told a lady friend, Miss
Carrie Berkowicz, who is coming to live with me.  I have just
got into a small job and Carrie has just got out of one, and we
don't know of none yet for you, but we'll keep looking and sure
will find one, and meantime we want you to come here and stop
with us just as soon as you can beat it from that place where
you are.  Don't you lose your nerve, and don't bother to talk about
things when you get here, because we know how it is.  You
needn't worry about how we feel, we have too many friends who
had the same bad luck as you, and least said soonest mended, we
think.  So come right here first chance you get and stay as long
as you like, and if we're not home when you get here sit on the
step till we do get home, and if anybody asks any questions just
say you're a friend of ours, because you are, and that's none of
their business anyhow, and nobody won't bother you any more.
</p>

<p class="letter">
"Now keep your head cool and God bless you with best
wishes!
</p>

<p class="letter">
  "From your friend<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"MISS KATIE FLANAGAN."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Without daring to lessen her courage by giving
way to the feelings that this letter stirred, Violet
read it twice, tore off the address, concealed it in
one of the "rats" on which the structure of her
russet hair was founded, and then tore the rest of
the epistle into small bits, which she flung out of
the narrow space between the riveted shutters of her
room.  She was now almost ready to strike.  In
her captivity, she had, after the first shock, made it
her business to learn what she could of those about
her.  She knew that Wesley Dyker had once been
what was called a straw-bail man, an agent who, for
a high consideration, provided bogus bail for such
women as the police, to keep up appearances, were
forced from time to time to arrest.  She had been
told that he was wont, for a still higher consideration,
to appear at court for these clients, in the rôle
of a defender of the wronged poor, and in a very
different rôle in their behalf with the dispensers of
justice to the underworld.  She had gathered that
his friendship with one political faction aided in
securing Rose the chance to purchase that expensive
police-protection toward which Angel, unknown to
Dyker, assisted Rose through an opposing faction.
And she believed that his ambition was now to gain
a magistracy from which he could grant bail on
bonds signed by his own servants, secure for prisoners
the legal service of men that would return him
a commission, and pronounce judgment or dispense
mercy for the furtherance of his own fortune and
the strengthening of his own power.  Out of these
threads of knowledge Violet resolved to weave the
net in which to catch freedom.
</p>

<p>
That afternoon Evelyn informed her that Rose
was still abed and had sent for her favorite, Wanda,
to console her.  This meant that she would not
descend to the ground floor or be visible to any
visitors before the next evening, and that the
Englishwoman, promoted to temporary command, would
have to pass the night in that reception of callers
which necessitated the appearance of drinking much
and the fact of drinking almost nothing.
</p>

<p>
"She does that every time she goes on a bust, my
dear," complained Evelyn.  "Of course she jolly
well knows that she can trust me and that I have
some manners too, but I wish she would remember
that I also have a thirst and can't do without my
drop of real liquor."
</p>

<p>
Violet's nerves tingled.  With her best effort to
bury all signs of her mounting hope, she ventured:
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could help you."
</p>

<p>
"You, my dear?"  Evelyn's eyebrows raised and
her contralto voice followed them.  "Catch the
madam letting anyone but me take charge!  You
know you're none of you allowed down in the front
hall unless you're sent for.  Things are ticklish
enough, thank you, with that new girl upstairs."
</p>

<p>
It was almost the first mention that had been made
to Violet of the latest captive since the recent day of
Evelyn's exposition of the entire traffic.  Violet had
not dared to ask any more questions than those that
she deemed necessary for the perfection of her own
plans, and she dared ask none now.
</p>

<p>
"I do hate the job," Evelyn was continuing,
"even if it does mean a few bits extra.  Rose says
that fellow Dyker is due to-night.  She's not fit to
see him above all men, and he's the one I most
particularly hate to meet, because he was a friend of
my friend the doctor and used to call with him now
and again at my flat.  I always fancy he's making
comparisons under those narsty low lids of his."
</p>

<p>
Violet, in sudden reaction, felt choking with despair.
</p>

<p>
"I could see him," she said.
</p>

<p>
But Evelyn's honors sat heavily upon their possessor.
</p>

<p>
"You're not a trusty yet, my dear, by any manner
of means," she responded.  "No, no; you will go
to your own room after dinner and stay there till
you are wanted."
</p>

<p>
She tilted her sharp chin and strolled kitchenward
for a drink; but, though she left behind Her a Violet
discouraged, it was not a Violet beaten.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the girl made her own opportunity.
Noticing that evening that Evelyn took up a dignified
position in the parlor and had Cassie conduct all
the guests thither, Violet quickly disposed of the first
person that claimed her attention, and, having made
her best toilet&mdash;having restored her cheeks to a
resemblance of their pristine glow, coiffed her russet
hair, and donned her best of linen&mdash;she descended
quietly to the first landing on the stairway, there to
take up her watch.  Before she was again in demand,
she saw the servant admit Wesley Dyker.  She ran
quickly downward and, just as Cassie stepped
forward to precede him, brushed by him in the rosy
twilight of the hall.
</p>

<p>
"Ask to see me," she whispered.  "Ask to see
Violet.  Don't let on I told you.  I've heard
something you want to know about O'Malley."
</p>

<p>
Before the man's shadowy figure could come to
pause, she had passed him and caught up to Cassie.
</p>

<p>
"Where have you been?" she asked.  "I've been
calling for you for five minutes.  I need some more
water in my room."
</p>

<p>
She turned and reascended the stairs, but her door
had not long been closed before the servant was
knocking upon the panel.
</p>

<p>
"Here's you' water, Miss Vi'let," said Cassie.
"An' Miste' Dyker wants fer to see you daown in
de back parlor."
</p>

<p>
Violet took the useless pitcher, made sure that the
remnant of Katie's note was secure in its hiding-place,
and hurried, with Cassie following, to the
garish room in which Dyker was awaiting her.
</p>

<p>
He was seated on the lazy, pillowed sofa on which
Violet had fallen asleep so soon after her arrival in
this house.  He was in evening-clothes that served
him, on the East Side, much as the advertised
portraits of certain patent-medicine makers serve their
proprietors, the flaccid whiteness of his face still
bearing traces of past beauty, the weakness of his
mouth hidden by his crisp, short, brown mustache,
and his heavy lids concealing the secret of his
steel-gray eyes.
</p>

<p>
He half rose as she entered, but she motioned him
to sit still.
</p>

<p>
"Hello!" she said, with the easy manner of the
house, which always seemed to presuppose a previous
acquaintance.  "Have you ordered anything?  I'm
terribly dry."
</p>

<p>
He took her hand and caught her meaning,
</p>

<p>
"So am I, Miss Violet," he answered.  "Let's
have something."
</p>

<p>
Violet turned to the servant.
</p>

<p>
"Cassie," she said, "bring up a couple of bottles."
</p>

<p>
She waited for the door to close, and then sat
down beside Dyker.
</p>

<p>
"Speak low," she cautioned.  "That girl will
listen if she can.  You'll have to pretend to be
making love to me."
</p>

<p>
Dyker regarded her with smiling approval.  Her
blue eyes shone with excitement and red blood fought
through the rouge on cheek and fully ripe mouth.
</p>

<p>
"What you ask will be both easy and pleasant,"
he answered.
</p>

<p>
"No, no; none of that.  This is no time for
bluffing.  Put your arm around my shoulder.  That way.
Now then, you heard what I told you in the
hall?"
</p>

<p>
Dyker, with his type's disinclination to take
seriously anything that any woman has to say upon
serious matters, smiled assent.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have been doing some listening
yourself," he said, as his lingers tightened
unnecessarily upon her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I did, and it's lucky for you I did it.  Will
you promise not to give me away?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I promise."
</p>

<p>
"Not even to Miss Rose?"
</p>

<p>
"Not even to Rosie."
</p>

<p>
"And if I help you, will you do me a favor?"
</p>

<p>
"To look at you I should say that I'd do you
any favor you asked, and do it without expecting
anything in return."
</p>

<p>
His pale lips were curled in a half-scoffing smile,
but Violet's next words brushed from his flaccid face
all traces of amusement.
</p>

<p>
"You remember that night you told Miss Rose
about what you wanted to get at the next election?
You said you were afraid of O'Malley giving you
the double cross."
</p>

<p>
Dyker stiffened.
</p>

<p>
"Did you hear that?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!  Keep your voice down, or I won't tell
you nothing of what I know.  Remember you're
supposed to be making love to me."
</p>

<p>
"All right, all right; but I want an answer to my
question."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, of course, I heard it.  I was at the
keyhole there&mdash;that's why I want you to
whisper now.&mdash;And I heard more."
</p>

<p>
"What was that?"
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute.  You'll do me a favor if I tell you?"
</p>

<p>
"Anything," he smiled.
</p>

<p>
"But this is business.  If I tell you something
that it's worth your while to know, will you promise
not to blow on me to Miss Rose?"
</p>

<p>
"I promise."
</p>

<p>
"And to do something more that I'll ask you?"
</p>

<p>
Wesley was now certain that he must not stick
at promises.
</p>

<p>
"Surely."
</p>

<p>
"Then sit tight.  I don't know as much about
O'Malley as I pretended out there in the hall, but
I do know about Miss Rose.  I don't know whether
O'Malley is goin' to double-cross you or not, but
I do know that Miss Rose has given you the
double-cross already."
</p>

<p>
She had thought that passion played a large part
in his relations with her mistress, and she had counted
upon awakening his jealousy.  What, however, had
far exceeded his affection was a poor pride of possession,
and when Violet's words, in addition to touching
his ambition, struck at that pride, they aroused
an anger that was far more dangerous than any
sense of love betrayed.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
Two red beacons flashed into his pale checks, and
his heavy lids, shooting upward for a single instant,
disclosed hard, gray eyes gone hot and malevolent.
</p>

<p>
"Be careful.  Speak low, I tell you," she
cautioned; "and remember your promise."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Here's Cassie!"
</p>

<p>
They waited while the black opened the
champagne and filled the glasses.
</p>

<p>
Violet brushed Dyker's hair over his eyes and
laughed at the effect.  Dyker caught the offending
hand and kissed it by way of punishment.
</p>

<p>
"Cassie," he banteringly asked, "why didn't you
ever tell me there was such a nice little girl in this
house?  I had to get the news from a friend on the
outside."
</p>

<p>
He tossed the now grinning negress a dollar and,
as soon as she had left them, dropped the farce as
promptly as did Violet.
</p>

<p>
"I say I can't believe you," he resumed, the two
spots of anger still glowering in his cheeks.
</p>

<p>
Violet knew that her whole hope rested upon her
ability to force conviction.
</p>

<p>
"You've got to believe me," she said.  "I'll tell
you all that you told Miss Rose till I had to run
away, that evening."
</p>

<p>
She did it, omitting scarcely a particular.
</p>

<p>
"That's right, ain't it?" she concluded.
</p>

<p>
"May be.  But what does that prove?  It only
shows that you heard me."
</p>

<p>
"It shows that I can hear Miss Rose when
she talks to somebody else.  And I did hear
her."
</p>

<p>
"Whom was she talking to?"
</p>

<p>
"The man you asked her about.  To Rafael Angelelli."
</p>

<p>
"Well, but I told her to talk to him."
</p>

<p>
"An' she did it.  But the first time I heard her
was just before you told her to."
</p>

<p>
"That same night?"
</p>

<p>
"He was in the kitchen with her when you came
in.  Why, he's here all the time!  I don't care what
she pretends to you, she's stuck on him, an' every
girl in the house knows it."
</p>

<p>
Rapidly, but as fully as she had sketched the
dialogue between Rose and Dyker, she now described
the first conversation that she had overheard between
her mistress and the Italian.
</p>

<p>
"I'd come down to graft a drink," she said, "an'
I heard them from the stairs.  That's how, after
he'd left, I came to listen to you too."
</p>

<p>
Dyker had quailed under the revelation, thus made
to him, of political danger.  He now quivered in
anger at the comments upon himself, somewhat
colored, that Violet had placed in the mouths of Rose
and Angel.
</p>

<p>
"I'll find out about this!" he said, struggling
against the desperate arms flung swiftly around him
to keep him on the sofa.  "Let me go!  By God,
I'll have that drunken cat down here and squeeze
the truth out of her throat!"
</p>

<p>
All the caution, all the craft, all that she had
counted upon as the real Wesley Dyker seemed to
have escaped him.  His voice was still low, but in
every other respect he was a raging beast.
</p>

<p>
She fought with him, mentally and physically.
</p>

<p>
"You can't get anything out of her that way,"
Violet urged, as the man twisted under her strong
hands.  "Of course she'll say it's all lies.  And
you'd only be warning her.  You don't want her to
know that you know; you want a chance to block her
game."
</p>

<p>
Partly convinced by this argument and partly
subdued by the physical restraint that accompanied
it, Dyker ceased his struggles.
</p>

<p>
"But I want to be sure," he muttered sullenly.
</p>

<p>
"You can't be sure by goin' to Miss Rose."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I ought to tell her."  The high tide of
his anger was slowly subsiding, and the rocky Dyker
that she had built on was beginning to show its crest
above the still hissing waves.  "Look here, Violet,"
he said, "I'm sorry I behaved like such a fool.  I
beg your pardon, but you must see that I have got
to put this thing up to Rose."
</p>

<p>
"You forget your promise."
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't, but I must make sure."
</p>

<p>
Violet thought rapidly.
</p>

<p>
"Listen," she said; "I told you I wanted you to
do something for me an' you gave your word you'd
do it.&mdash;Will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I will, only I'm thinking a little about
myself."
</p>

<p>
"This will help you, too."
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?"
</p>

<p>
Violet drew a long breath.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to go over to the avenue right
away," she said, "and buy me a long cloak and a
hat and bring them back, and then take me out of
here without a word to anybody.  You needn't walk
more'n three squares with me, an' then I won't bother
you no more."
</p>

<p>
Dyker drew away and whistled softly.  His face
grew quite composed again.  The heavy lids fell
over his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"So that's it, is it?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I want to get away," said Violet.
</p>

<p>
"And so you've cooked up this little mess of lies
to make me the goat, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Violet felt the sands slipping beneath her feet.
She laced her fingers together till the knuckles bruised
her flesh.
</p>

<p>
"Don't do that," she pleaded; "don't take it
that way; it's true, what I told you, every word of
it.  I only want you to keep your promise to me."
</p>

<p>
She stopped with a sob, and waited.
</p>

<p>
Wesley reached calmly for a glass of wine, drank
it, put down the glass, thrust his hands deep into
his trousers' pockets, and, stretching out his long
legs, regarded, humming, the toes of his shining
pumps.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe you," he said at last.
</p>

<p>
"But, Mr. Dyker&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It's too thin."
</p>

<p>
"Even if it was a lie," Violet despairingly
persisted, "you ought to help me.  Do you know who
I am?"
</p>

<p>
"That's the point."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know how I was brought here?"
</p>

<p>
"I can guess."
</p>

<p>
"I was tricked.  The man said he wanted to
marry me.  I didn't know.  I believed him.  An'
they beat me an' starved me and did things I couldn't
think about an' couldn't help thinkin' about.  An'
all I want is just for you to do me this one little
favor.  I won't bother you.  I won't blow on
you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What's that?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you know I wouldn't blow on you!  I
couldn't.  I want to forget the whole thing.  I've
got friends to go to who'll get me work.  I only
want you to get me out of the door and safe
away."
</p>

<p>
Like most men of his sort Dyker, although ready
enough to make a living out of the results of cruelty,
hated the sight of cruelty's self.  The girl's words
touched, though lightly, his selfish heart.
</p>

<p>
"But I can't afford to help you," he protested.
"You see how I'm tied up here.  I can't have Rose
jump on me now."
</p>

<p>
"You know she's jumping on you already.  You
know she's knifing you in the back.  The only way
you can stop her is by using what I've told you."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Dyker in the tone of a man
thinking aloud, "if she really was playing both ends
against the middle, I could pull her teeth by going
straight to O'Malley and telling him so."
</p>

<p>
Violet did not wholly understand this, but she
agreed immediately.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you could," she said.
</p>

<p>
"And I suppose I could have her pinched then,
if you'd testify against her.  Would you do that?
Would you go into court?"
</p>

<p>
Violet's fingers closed spasmodically.
</p>

<p>
"Just give me the chanc't," she said fervently.
</p>

<p>
"And of course there are other girls who've been
in the same scrape here?"
</p>

<p>
"There's a new one upstairs this minute."
</p>

<p>
"There is?  Um.  That's good."  He rattled the
money in his pocket.  "Only, look here," he persisted,
"if you have been telling the truth, it will
probably make me solid with O'Malley, but if you
haven't, I'll go clean to smash."
</p>

<p>
Violet saw the turn of affairs and, with hope's
revival, her mind cleared immediately.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't told you all," she said, "and I guess
the rest will make you sure enough."
</p>

<p>
"There's more then?"
</p>

<p>
"A lot."
</p>

<p>
"What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Will you help me out of here?"
</p>

<p>
"If you convince me.&mdash;Let's see; the shops around
here are still open.&mdash;Yes, if you convince me, you'll
be out of here in half an hour."
</p>

<p>
It was her only chance.  She did not hesitate.
She told him the whole of what she had heard of
the later assuring interview between Rose and Angelelli.
</p>

<p>
This time he listened quietly, his face inscrutable.
</p>

<p>
"That all?" he asked when she had ended.
</p>

<p>
"That's all," she said.
</p>

<p>
"It's the truth?"
</p>

<p>
"Ain't I sayin' it proof that it's true?  How
could I make it up?  I don't know all that it means."
</p>

<p>
"You knew enough to pass it on to me."
</p>

<p>
"Lucky for you I did, too; but I don't know all
it means&mdash;how could I?&mdash;and you do know, an' that
ought to be proof enough that it's God's truth,
Mr. Dyker."
</p>

<p>
She stopped.  Her case was with the jury.
</p>

<p>
Dyker rose.
</p>

<p>
"Cassie!" he called.
</p>

<p>
Violet leaped to her feet and laid her hands on
his arm.
</p>

<p>
"What are you goin' to do?" she whispered.
</p>

<p>
He silenced her with a gesture.
</p>

<p>
"What you want," he said.
</p>

<p>
Cassie put her black head in at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Cassie," he continued, flipping the maid another
dollar, "I'm a little off my feed.  I'm going to the
drugstore on the corner and get fixed up."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Miste' Dyker.&mdash;Ah kin go fer you,
Miste' Dyker," said the negress.  "Thank you,
sah."
</p>

<p>
"No, thanks, Cassie, I can go myself; I want the
air.  But you can do something else for me.  You
can just not let this girl run away from me.  I know
she would run if she could, but I like her too well
to let her, so if anybody wants her, just you say
she's in here and engaged for the evening by me.
I'll be back in fifteen minutes."
</p>

<p>
He left one door as the willingly assenting Cassie
closed the other, and Violet flung herself on the sofa
and buried her face in the cushions, now fearful that
the servant, notwithstanding their precautions, had
overheard her, now afraid that Dyker would change
his purpose and fail to return, and again dreading
that he might betray her to Rose.  Since the night
she had waited for Max to telephone in the café,
since the terrible morning that had followed, it was
the longest quarter of an hour that she had known,
but it at last dragged its quivering length away.
The doorbell rang.  Cassie passed through the room
to find Violet sitting suddenly upright, and at once
returned with Dyker, his summer raincoat tossed
across his arm.
</p>

<p>
As the servant left them, he lifted the coat.
Below it, not wrapped in the paper usual to a new
purchase, was a dark cloak.  He unrolled it,
uncovered a beaver hat, and handed them both to the
panting Violet.
</p>

<p>
"Here you are," he said quietly.
</p>

<p>
She seized them and began to put them on.
</p>

<p>
"No," he cautioned, "on second thought, I guess
I'd better carry them.  The parlor door's open, and
Evelyn and Fritzie are in there with a couple of men.
I'll go ahead and open the vestibule door and the
front door.  Then you come by as if you were going
upstairs."
</p>

<p>
"Evelyn'll come out to see if I have any money."
</p>

<p>
"She'll never learn that, though here, by the way,
is a ten-dollar bill that will come in handy.&mdash;The
doors will be open and I'll be on the pavement.
Keep only a yard behind me.  Riley's at the other
end of his beat, and I have a cab at the curb.
Ready?"
</p>

<p>
She could not speak, but she nodded her russet
head.
</p>

<p>
He passed before her up the rosy twilight of the
hall.
</p>

<p>
Violet, following, her lips tight, her breathing
suspended, her heart pounding against her breast,
was dimly aware of her own soft footfalls sounding
hideously loud, of the blast of light and laughter
from the parlor.
</p>

<p>
Dyker flung wide the vestibule door.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night!" he called to Evelyn.
</p>

<p>
"Going?  Good-night!" Violet heard the
Englishwoman answer.
</p>

<p>
She heard Evelyn rise.  She heard the front door
open.  She saw Wesley raise his arm.
</p>

<p>
She hurried by the parlor door, and then, instead
of turning to the stairs, gathered up her red kimona
and ran through the vestibule, through a patch of
soft, fresh darkness, and was tossed precipitately
into a cab into which Dyker followed her just as the
horse, under a quick blow, dashed madly up the
street.
</p>

<p>
At the open cab-window the night air beat upon
her fevered face.  She drank it deep into her
thirsting lungs.  It was the wine of freedom.

<br><br>
RIVINGTON STREET
</h3>

<p>
The eastern end of Rivington Street is a hectic
thoroughfare.  Often it is so hectic as to be
no thoroughfare at all, but only a tossing
fever-dream, a whirling phantasmagoria of noisy
shadows, grotesque and reasonless.  It seems a street
with a bad conscience, for it never sleeps.
</p>

<p>
The dawn, even in summertime, hesitates long
before it comes shivering up from the crowded East
River to drop a few grudged rays of anæmic light
on Rivington Street.  Already, out of the humming
courts, the black alleys, and the foul passages that
feed this avenue as gutters feed a sewer, a long
funeral procession of little handcarts has groped its
way and taken a mournful stand beside the fetid
curbs; and soon, pausing at these carts to buy the
rank morsels of breakfast that there is never time
to eat at home, the gray army of the workers begins
to scurry westward.
</p>

<p>
First come the market-laborers, with shoulders
bowed and muscles cramped from the bearing of
many burdens.  Upon their heels march the pale
conscripts of the sweatshops, their hands shaking,
their cheeks sunken, their eyes hot from loss of sleep.
Follow the sad-lipped factory-girls, women before
their time, old women before their youth, and then
the long line of predestined shop-clerks, most of them
still in short skirts and all of them, befittingly, in
mourning-black.  Swiftly they go, the whole corps
of them, the whole corps strangely silent.
</p>

<p>
The street is not emptied of them before it is
filled again, now by solemn children on their way
to school, children whose gaze is fixed, whose mouths
are maturely set, and whose voices, when they are
heard at all, are high, strident, nervous.  As these
go by, the shops begin to do business: the cheap
food-shops, the old-clothes shops, the shops that sell
second-hand five-cent novels for a copper, and the
pawnbrokers'.  The shawl-hooded housewives clutter in
and out, selling first that they may buy afterward,
and continuing like ants swarming about an ant-hill
until noon strikes and the children parade stolidly
away from school for luncheon, and back again.
</p>

<p>
At that hour the underworld of Rivington Street
enough recovers from its drunkenness of the night
preceding to stagger forth and drink again.  The
doors of the shouldering saloons swing open and
bang shut in a running accompaniment, and the
highway rocks with it until a cloud of clattering
two-wheeled push-carts swoops from "The Push-Cart
Garage" around the corner and alights as if it were
a plague of pestilent flies.  Bearded Jews propel
these, Jews with shining derbies far back upon their
heads, who work sometimes for themselves, but more
often for the owners of the push-cart trust, who
squabble for positions in the gutter where an
impotent law forbids any of them long to remain, but
where, once entrenched, they stand for hours, selling
stockings at five cents and shirts at ten, mirrors and
vegetables, suspenders and lithographs, shoestrings
and picture-postcards, collars of linen and celluloid,
all sorts of cheap dress-material, every description
of brush, fruit, and cigar-butts.
</p>

<p>
The carts are end-to-end now; one could walk
upon them from cross-street to cross-street.  Each
has its separate gasoline torch leaping up, in flame
and smoke, to the descending darkness.  Upon them
charge the returning army of workers.  The crowd
is all moving eastward; you could not make six yards
of progress to the west; the sidewalks overflow, the
street is filled.  The silence of the morning has
changed to a mad chorus of discords.  The thousand
weary feet shuffle, the venders shriek their wares;
there is every imaginable sound of strife and traffic,
but there is no distinguishable note of mirth.  Wagons
jostle pedestrians, graze children, are blocked,
held up, turned away.  The thoroughfare is like a
boiling cauldron; it can hold no more, and still it
must hold more and more.
</p>

<p>
Only very slowly, as the night wears on, do the
crowd and noise lessen; but at last, by tardy degrees,
they do lessen.  Imperceptibly, but inevitably, even
this portion of New York breathes somewhat easier.
By twos and threes the people melt away; a note
at a time, the cries weaken and the shuffling dies;
and finally, in the small hours of the morning,
Rivington Street turns over, with a troubled sigh, to
a restless doze.
</p>

<p>
But to doze only.  Its bad conscience will grant
it no absolute oblivion, no perfect rest, however brief.
Cats yell from the dizzy edges of the lower roofs;
dogs howl from the doorsteps.  Back in the narrow
courts and alleys and passages, drunken battles are
won and lost.  The elevated cars roar out the minutes
through the nocturnal distances.  An ambulance
clangs into a byway street.  A patrol-wagon clatters
past.  Rivington Street turns and tosses on its hot
couch, and through its dreams slink hideous shadows
that dare not show themselves by day.  One, ten, a
hundred, each alone, they come and go: vague,
inhuman.  And then, reluctantly, the hesitant dawn
creeps shivering out of the East River, and the weary
day begins again.
</p>

<p>
Into this street&mdash;into its noisiest quarter at its
noisiest time&mdash;the cab that bore Violet on her way
to liberty at last turned and proceeded as far under
the flaring gasoline torches as the evening crowd of
workers, buyers, and sellers, would permit.  The girl,
through the dark thoroughfares that had preceded
it, had answered a score of questions, which Dyker
had asked her, the fever of escape beating high in
her breast and tossing ready replies to her heated
lips; but now, in the roar and brilliance of Rivington
Street's nocturnal traffic, there had come upon her
a terror almost equal to that which had assailed her
when, with Max for her guide, the lighted length
of East Fourteenth Street had first unrolled itself
before her.  The city was again an inimical monster
awaiting her descent from the cab, and the newly
acquired habit of seclusion, the habit of the prisoner,
recoiled upon her.  Freedom was strange; it became
awesome, and when the horse was stopped and Violet
knew that she must soon fare alone, she cowered in
a corner, breathing hard.
</p>

<p>
"Can't go no furder, boss," said the cabby, leaning
far around from his seat.  "Where to now?"
</p>

<p>
"Nowhere right away," answered Dyker.  "Just
stand where you are for a minute."
</p>

<p>
Then he turned to Violet.
</p>

<p>
"Now," he said, not unkindly, "I'm afraid I'll
have to drop you here.  It wouldn't do for me to
figure publicly as an active agent in this case, you
know.  But you needn't worry.  Just get out and
walk to the next corner.  Turn to your right, take
the next cross-street to your left, go up the first
narrow street you come to, and your friend's house
ought to be about the third in the row.  It will be a
little dark, but you won't have any trouble finding it."
</p>

<p>
Violet hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"I hope I won't," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Surely not.  If you have, just ask the way of
the first policeman you see."
</p>

<p>
"Not a policeman, Mr. Dyker!"
</p>

<p>
"Of course, a policeman.  He won't hurt you
as long as you keep your cloak tight.  Now, you're
sure you've given me the right address?"
</p>

<p>
"I gave you the one the man gave me."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but I mean you're not lying to me?"
</p>

<p>
Violet's wide eyes should have been sufficient
denial.
</p>

<p>
"Why would I do that?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"That's so; only I thought&mdash;well, I beg your
pardon, Violet.  You have my office-address on that
card.  I'll send for you in a day or two&mdash;be sure
to be home every afternoon&mdash;and then we'll fix
Madame Rose with the District-Attorney.&mdash;Good-by.
Sure you're not afraid?"
</p>

<p>
Her gratitude would not permit her to acknowledge fear.
</p>

<p>
"Not afraid," she smiled, rather grimly.
</p>

<p>
"Then remember: the first street to your right,
the next to your left, and then to your right
again&mdash;third or fourth house in the row."
</p>

<p>
He opened the cab-door and alighted, holding out
his hand.
</p>

<p>
She straightened her beaver hat, drew the folds
of her dark cloak tightly over the betraying crimson
of her kimona, and, helped by his grasp, followed
him to the swarming curb.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I don't know how to thank you," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Then don't try," returned Dyker, laughing
easily.  "You can make it all right with me when
you testify against Rose."
</p>

<p>
She kept his hand a moment longer, partly in fear
of the human multitude about her and partly in
genuine gratitude.
</p>

<p>
"But I do thank you," she said.
</p>

<p>
Dyker, not too well liking the white light of
publicity in which this little scene was being enacted,
pressed her hand and dropped it.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," he responded.  "Just don't
forget your promise."  He stepped back into the
cab.  "Good-by, and good luck," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Good-by," he heard her answer, and then, with
his head out of the cab-window, he saw her pause
bewilderedly.  "To your right," he cautioned.
</p>

<p>
He watched her turn.  He saw her plunge into the
crowd.  He saw the crowd swallow her up.
</p>

<p>
"Take me over to my office," he ordered the
driver, and added his address.
</p>

<p>
Once there, he dismissed the cab, climbed the steps
of what seemed an old and modest little house, and,
opening the door and turning into the front room,
lit a gas-jet the flame of which revealed an apartment
surprisingly new and arrogant.  The walls were
lined with new bookcases holding rows of new
law-books, and surrounded by rows of new chairs.  The
flat-top desk in the center, at which his stenographer
sat by daylight, was a new desk, with new wire-baskets
upon it, and a new telephone, to which Dyker
now immediately proceeded and called a number.
</p>

<p>
"Hello," he said into the transmitter, adopting
the low tone that he always used in his wired
conversations.  "Is that Schleger's?&mdash;It is?&mdash;That you,
Ludwig?&mdash;This is Dyker.&mdash;Yes, good-evening,
Ludwig.&mdash;Yes, pretty good, thank you.  How are you,
and how's business?&mdash;That's good.  Mrs. Schleger
and the babies all right?&mdash;I'll bet that boy's gained
three pounds!&mdash;He has?  I'm glad to hear it.
You're a wonder.&mdash;Yes.&mdash;That's what I said.  And,
say, Ludwig, is O'Malley anywhere around?&mdash;He
isn't?&mdash;Hasn't been in this evening?&mdash;Oh!  Well,
I wonder where I can find him.&mdash;You don't?  Perhaps
he's at Dugan's place.&mdash;No, it's not anything
important: I just wanted to take a drink with him,
that's all.  He's sure to be at Dugan's or Venturio's,
but I guess I won't bother.  Ever so much obliged,
Ludwig.&mdash;Good-by."
</p>

<p>
In spite of his word, Dyker did, however, bother.
He called three other numbers in his quest of the
political boss, and when he found him, the underling
made a pressing appointment for an important
conference on the next morning, though what it was that
he wanted then to discuss he carefully neglected to
mention over a telephone-wire.
</p>

<p>
He hung up the receiver in a glow of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"And now," he said, "I think I'll get away for
the night.  I don't care to have any arguments with
Rose for a day or two."
</p>

<p>
Yet, even as he said it, the telephone-bell uttered
its staccato summons.  He stood uncertainly beside
the desk.
</p>

<p>
"She wouldn't have the nerve to use the wire,"
he argued.  "Perhaps it's O'Malley with more to
say."
</p>

<p>
Again the bell rang, and his curiosity overcame
his caution.  He took up the receiver.
</p>

<p>
"Hello!" he said sharply, and then his tone
mellowed, for the voice that came to him across the
hurrying New York night was the voice of Marian
Lennox.
</p>

<p>
"Is that Mr. Dyker's office?" it asked.
</p>

<p>
"It is the head of the firm himself," he answered,
"and mighty glad to hear from you."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you're glad," the voice pursued, "because
I want to ask a favor."
</p>

<p>
"It is as good as performed.  What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"I have been down town, and remained longer
than I intended, and I want you, please, to take
me home."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you were asking a favor, not bestowing
one.  Where are you?"
</p>

<p>
"At the settlement."
</p>

<p>
"In Rivington Street?"  Wesley set his teeth as
he asked it.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, I'll be over right away."
</p>

<p>
He rang off and left the office.  He was sorry
that he had dismissed the cab, for he expected to
need it when he reached the first stage of his journey;
but the way was not long to the place that Marian
had named, and, even had it been twice as far to
the settlement, Dyker, who walked thither with the
feet of chagrin, would not have remarked the distance.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of Rivington Street, in a house that
used, long ago, to be a Methodist parsonage, a little
group of devoted women are doing their best to redeem,
by social activities, the people of the neighborhood
from the benighted condition in which the people's
lot is cast.  This best has now been done for
more years than a few, and the people, still considering
it necessary to remain alive, and still knowing
that to remain alive they must submit to the economic
system imposed upon them, continue discouragingly
unredeemed.  But the devoted women, though they
neglect the disease for its symptoms, persist as only
feminine natures can persist.
</p>

<p>
They are college-bred women with the limitations
and emancipations of their class; and they have a
great deal to occupy their attention besides their
essays in social entertainment.  For the most part
they pass their days in really practical investigation.
One of them will inspect the public schools and
impartially consider curricula and ventilation.  Another
will visit tenements and ask housewives personal
questions for the tabular benefit of the Russell Sage
Foundation.  A third goes into the laundries of the
best hotels and finds that these hostelries force their
washerwomen to sleep twenty in a room.  Yet, when
they return to Rivington Street, these daylight
investigators spur their wearied nerves to further
exertion and go forward, not to teach the toilers the
practical cause and remedy of the economic evil, but
to form the boys and girls, the young women and
young men, into reading groups, debating clubs, sewing
circles, cooking classes, and elocutionary juntas.
Their zeal is boundless, their martyrdom sadly
genuine, and, if there is humor, there is something more
than humor in their ultimate complaint:
</p>

<p>
"Some of our people we retain, but most of them
slip away, and, even with the best of fortune, we
seem, somehow, able to do so little."
</p>

<p>
Dyker knew the place by reputation.  He had
always scorned it for its own sake, and now he had
come to hate it for Marian's.  For want of a better
term, it may be repeated that he was in love with
Marian.  Moreover, he wished the assistance that
an early marriage with the daughter of a wealthy
department-store owner would give him in the coming
campaign.  And, finally, his peculiar legal
activities were already well enough known on the East
Side to make it probable that any young woman
entering the settlement would speedily learn of
them.
</p>

<p>
After the night of the opera his cooler reflection
had rejected Marian's plan of joining the Rivington
Street colony as a fervently girlish dream destined to
fade before the reality of action.  He had decided
that the best way to aid its dissipation was no longer
to combat it, and he had even, during the months that
had followed, seen Marian but rarely, and never
alone.  Occupied with politics and knowing the tactical
value of restraint, he had not so much as pressed
his wooing.  He had relied upon what he chose to
describe as his sweetheart's basic commonsense to
work out their common salvation, and had decided
that, this commonsense being what he esteemed it,
Marian was a woman more likely to be won by a
Fabian campaign than by a Varric attack.
</p>

<p>
The point wherein these calculations erred was
their underestimation of the momentum of a girlish
impulse.  That method of consideration which makes
one slow to reach convictions works beyond the
convictions and retards one from action upon them, once
they are achieved, but the impulsive mind that bolts
a creed unmasticated straightway drives its owner,
in the creed's behalf, to the thumbscrews or the
wrack.  It is from the pods of half-baked opinions
that there is shaken the seed of the church: Marian
meant to keep to her purpose.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps Wesley's silence and the subtle sense of
pique that it awakened played a part in this;
perhaps the purpose was self-sufficient; but, in either
case, Marian missed scarcely an evening at the
settlement.  Two of her former classmates were
knee-deep in the work there, and what she saw and what
they told her served only to confirm her.  It thus
happened that, anxious again to see him alone,
and more anxious to let him know the endurance
of her resolution, she had, on this evening,
telephoned on the chance of finding him late at his
office.
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens!" he gasped as she met him at
the settlement's door.  "What on earth are you doing
in this part of town at this hour of the night?
Let me 'phone for a taxi."
</p>

<p>
What, as a matter of fact, she had been doing
was to listen to slim little Luigi Malatesta and fat
little Morris Binderwitz respectively attacking and
defending the proposition that Abraham Lincoln was
a greater American than George Washington; but
what she thought she had been doing was assisting
in raising the lower half of society.  Under this
impression, her fine brown eyes shone with the
consciousness of moral rectitude, her mouth was even
more than usually firm, and her head even more than
usually like some delicate cameo.
</p>

<p>
"One thing at a time, please," she imperturbably
answered.  "First, no taxicab.  It isn't far to Second
Avenue, which is quiet enough, and I want to walk
for a few blocks."
</p>

<p>
She took the arm that he grimly offered, and he
began to break his way through the noisy crowd
under the flaring gasoline lamps of the push-carts.
Coherent conversation was at first impossible, but
Dyker felt a glow of pride as, with her fingers closed
in tight trust upon him, he shouldered a passage for
her, and Marian herself was not insusceptible to the
thrill inherent in the situation.  Nevertheless, the
girl, as soon as they had turned northward, reverted
to her former attitude; and the man, knowing well
that all this meant that she was still determined upon
a course necessarily delaying his wooing and perhaps
resulting in his discovery, frankly resumed his
opposition.  He did more and worse: he swept aside all
his method of silence, all his plans of conquest
through non-resistance.
</p>

<p>
"Now," he said, continuing their interrupted
talk, "I should really like to know what you, of
all people in the world, were doing on Rivington
Street."
</p>

<p>
"I was there," she announced serenely, "because
I have made up my mind that it is I, of all people
in the world, who ought to be there."
</p>

<p>
"Marian,"&mdash;he almost stopped as he said it&mdash;"are
you really in earnest about this fancy?  Do you
honestly mean that you are seriously considering any
such chimerical course?"
</p>

<p>
He had, naturally, chosen precisely the tone that,
were any additional incentive required, would have
compelled her to resolution.  Her mind, as it chanced,
was, however, made up, and what he now said served
only to turn her toward that feminine logic which
assumes as done that which is determined.
</p>

<p>
"I am past consideration," she said.  "I have
already virtually begun."
</p>

<p>
"Marian!  You're joking."
</p>

<p>
"I am simply stating a fact.  Why do you
suppose I have been staying in town this summer?  I
begin my real work at the settlement with the first
of next week."
</p>

<p>
Her classmates in Rivington Street, could they
have heard this, would have been pleased, but they
would also have been surprised.  Nevertheless, she
at once mentally decided to make good her declaration.
</p>

<p>
In the darkness Dyker bit the lip that, under his
short, crisp mustache, trembled with vexation.
</p>

<p>
"You really mean that?"
</p>

<p>
She bowed a brief assent.
</p>

<p>
"Then what, if you please, do you propose to do
when you get there?"
</p>

<p>
As to that Marian found herself suddenly certain.
</p>

<p>
"You ought to know," she said, "how these people
are living; you ought to know how the
girls&mdash;hundreds and hundreds of them&mdash;are every week
going into lives of shame and death.  I mean to
do what I can to stop them."
</p>

<p>
It would have been a hard thing for her to say
to him had he not wrought upon her anger, and had
not the freshness of her partial glimpse of earth's
lower seven-eighths fired her heart with a blind
inspiration.  She had the partial vision that makes
the martyr: a vision that shows just enough of an
evil to confirm the necessity of action and not enough
to prove how little individual action individually
directed can be worth.
</p>

<p>
For the second time Wesley gasped.  Here were
depths in her of which he had not dreamed, and
because he had not dreamed of them he would not
admit them.
</p>

<p>
"But you can't!" he protested.  "It is impossible
that you should.  It's inconceivable that a woman
of your delicacy should go into such coarse work!"
</p>

<p>
"Is it better that it should be left to coarse
women?  It seems to me that there has been enough
of coarseness in it already."
</p>

<p>
"But this&mdash;why, it's something that one can't even
speak about!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, something that we are not permitted even
to mention, Wesley; and because we aren't permitted
even to mention it, the thing grows and grows, night
by night.  It thrives in the shadow of our silence.
They tell me that the liquor laws are broken, because
nobody will mention it; that bestial men get rich in
it, because nobody will mention it; that in this city
alone there are three hundred saloon dance-halls
intended to furnish its supply, because nobody will
mention it!"
</p>

<p>
Figuratively, Dyker threw up his hands in horror,
but actually, like all desperate men, he seized at the
straws of detail.
</p>

<p>
"Now, that just shows how wrong your view of
the whole subject happens to be," he declared.  "My
work has put me in a position to know something
about these dance-halls, and I know that they exist
simply because the girls that go to them want them
to exist&mdash;the girls, mark you; not the men.  Why,
the girls aren't taken to such places; they go of
themselves, they pay their own admission, and it is
the usual thing for a girl earning six dollars a week
in a store to save fifty cents out of every
salary-envelope for the dance-halls."
</p>

<p>
"Then you want me to conclude that the fact
that they want to do the thing makes the thing
right?"
</p>

<p>
"You don't understand&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Precisely; and so I mean to learn."
</p>

<p>
"You can't learn.  No matter how closely you
study this whole matter, you can't learn, Marian.
How can a clean-hearted, clean-lived American girl
ever get the point of view of these low-down,
low-browed foreigners?  It's the sort of thing they're
used to."
</p>

<p>
"Before they begin it?"
</p>

<p>
"It's the survival of the fittest."
</p>

<p>
"Then can't some be made more fit to survive?"
</p>

<p>
"It's the law of life, and it can't be stopped."
</p>

<p>
"So was negro slavery the law of life.  It couldn't
be stopped either&mdash;until we stopped it."
</p>

<p>
"That is all theory, Marian; it won't work out
in practice.  The great point is that these
unfortunate women, whether they become unfortunate
through the dance-halls or anywhere else, are simply
not our sort of clay: they're not Americans."
</p>

<p>
"They are human beings."
</p>

<p>
"A pretty low example."
</p>

<p>
"And they are more Americans than your ancestors
or mine were three hundred years ago."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense.  They're different, I tell you&mdash;different.
Seriously, I know what I am talking about:
I speak from systematic investigations, reports,
statistics.  The very latest investigation shows that all
but about thirteen per cent. of these women were
either born abroad or else are the children of
foreign parents.  It is always the newest immigrants
that swell the ranks, and of course the newest
immigrants are our lowest type."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see that all this alters the question."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it does."
</p>

<p>
"The lower they are, the more plainly it is our
duty to raise them."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Marian, how can you raise them when
you don't understand them?"
</p>

<p>
Marian shook her handsome head.
</p>

<p>
"You <i>will</i> come back to that," she said; "and
all that I can answer is that, not being utterly stupid,
and having come to understand a few abstract problems,
I have hopes of mastering something so close
at hand to me and so concrete as a fellow human
being."
</p>

<p>
"What, for instance?" asked Wesley, "can you
understand of the typical Jewish girl of the East
Side?"
</p>

<p>
"A good deal, I think.  They were talking about
that type at the settlement this evening.  We were
looking from the front windows at an endless stream
of Jewish girls tramping home from the factories
where they worked to the tenements where they slept.
Somebody said there are nearly four hundred thousand
Jews living east of the Bowery; that in most
Jewish families the ambition to which every comfort
must be sacrificed is the education of the boys; that
for this reason the girls must work and are worked
until there is nowhere else in the world where so
much labor is got out of young women, and yet that
the Jewess that is not married and a mother before
she is twenty is regarded as a family disgrace.
It seems to me, Wesley, that the case of those
girls is pretty easy to understand.  It seems to
me that they are on the horns of a rather ugly
dilemma."
</p>

<p>
Dyker's cane whipped the air as if it were striking
at the heads of opposing arguments.
</p>

<p>
"You accept as gospel," he said, "everything that
is told you by anybody but me.  It isn't a pleasant
subject, but, if you insist upon facts, let me tell
you that there are troops of Jewesses who come down
here from the upper Ghetto and walk the streets for
no other purpose than to get money for their
wedding trousseaus."
</p>

<p>
It was a blow at her conventions, and she shuddered;
but she stood by her guns.  They had crossed
down Twenty-sixth Street now and they turned into
the quiet of Madison Avenue, among comfortable
houses and silent churches, as she answered.
</p>

<p>
"If they do that," she said, "it is because they
have to."
</p>

<p>
"Have to?  Why on earth should they have to?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, but I know that the very use
they make of the money shows what they do is only
a means and not an end."
</p>

<p>
"Are trousseaus so necessary that these girls have
to sell their souls for them?"
</p>

<p>
"Souls have been sold for less.  Even you and
I make considerable sacrifices for things that other
people in other classes would not think needful at
all."
</p>

<p>
He had done his best to bridle his annoyance, but
now he could bridle it no longer.  He was wholly
sincere in his inability to take seriously either the
girl or her point of view, and now, though he felt
as if he were riding a hunter at a butterfly, he
charged blindly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please don't let us jump at sentiment and
theory," he remonstrated; "let us keep our feet on
figures and fact.  The figures grow with the population;
they always have so grown and they always
will so grow.  And the plain fact is that, though a
few good people have been trying to stop this thing
for four thousand years, they have never succeeded
in doing anything but soiling themselves in the attempt."
</p>

<p>
"I know that," she frankly acknowledged, "and
I don't know what it is that's to blame; but I know
that there isn't any evil that hasn't some cure if we
can only find it out."
</p>

<p>
"Then why not leave the search for a cure to the
experienced?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall; but I propose to become one of the
experienced.  I mean to give my time, at least for a
while, to first-hand study.  Perhaps then I shall learn
enough to know that it's useless for me to go on,
but I shall keep trying to go on until I am convinced
that there isn't any use in the trying."
</p>

<p>
"That's absurd, Marian&mdash;simply absurd.  The
condition is, after all, one that must be dealt with
by the law, and I tell you honestly that, as yet, even
the law is helpless."
</p>

<p>
"Has the law really tried?  Has it ever attempted,
for instance, to do anything to the men
that take these immigrant girls at the dock and make
slaves of them?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it has; it has tried just that.  In Chicago
two men were arrested for taking a couple of such
girls&mdash;they had brought them from New York&mdash;and
when the case was appealed, the United States
Supreme Court found that, though importation of
girls was a violation of federal law, yet the federal
law providing a punishment for merely <i>harboring</i>
such girls after their arrival was unconstitutional."
</p>

<p>
Marian's voice faltered.
</p>

<p>
"Is&mdash;is that true?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely," said Dyker.  Like most lawyers of
his generation, his ideas of what was right were
limited only by the final decisions of what was legal,
and if the Supreme Court of the United States had,
by even a majority of one, declared that the sun
moved around the earth, Dyker would have first
denied and then forgotten all previous astronomy.
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely," he repeated, and awaited her capitulation.
</p>

<p>
But Marian did not capitulate.  She merely drew
a long breath and answered:
</p>

<p>
"After all, that, of course, is just a small portion
of the big question, and the only way it moves me is
to lessen my opinion of the Supreme Court."
</p>

<p>
It was Wesley's turn to gasp, and he did so.  He
had always suspected that these college-settlements
were hotbeds of Socialism and Anarchy&mdash;two
theories that, to Dyker, were one and the same&mdash;and
now he had his confirmation.
</p>

<p>
He was too cynically wrong upon one side of their
subject to realize how emotionally wrong she, in
her hope of accomplishment through personal appeal,
might be upon the other.  But here was a concrete
denial of his one sincere conviction, and, though he
was at last calm enough to see that he must not
allow this conviction to wreck his suit, he was not
so calm as to maintain a clear judgment.  It was
plain that Marian would not be turned from her
experiment.  His best course was, he then reasoned,
immediately to put on record his opinion of its
futility, even to quarrel with her in defense of that
opinion, and then, when experience brought the
awakening upon which his own worldly experience
counted, to stand ready to profit by the inevitable
reaction that would most likely show the perfidy of
the women whom Marian hoped to help, detract
from the credibility of any gossip they might
recount concerning him, and end by winning him his
wife.
</p>

<p>
"All right," he said sharply, "it is perfectly
useless to talk reasonably to anybody that can take such
a view of so simple a matter.  Here is Thirty-fourth
Street.  I think we had better walk over to Broadway
and get that taxi."
</p>

<p>
The worst thing that a man can impute to a handsome
woman is a lack of intellect.  Marian's cheeks
flushed.
</p>

<p>
"I quite agree with you," she replied.  "I am
utterly incapable of arguing with anybody that so
confuses law and justice."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Dyker; "but I want you to
remember what I have said upon the subject as a
whole.  When you have trusted these women and
been betrayed by them, when they have poisoned
your mind against all the principles you have been
brought up to believe, when you have left the world
of sentiment and bruised your poor hands with
hammering at the door of fact, then you will acknowledge
that I have been right.  I am not angry&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course not!"
</p>

<p>
"I am not angry, but I am firm.  I only ask you
to believe that I shall never be far away from the
settlement, and that you have only to telephone for
me when you have need of me."
</p>

<p>
Marian compressed her lips to a more severe firmness,
and the ride from Thirty-fourth Street to Riverside
Drive was made in silence; but the following
Monday found her, against all parental protests,
enlisted as a settlement-worker in Rivington Street.

XV
<br><br>
IMPARTIAL JUSTICE
</h3>

<p>
Michael M. O'Malley, political boss,
held his court, that next morning, in the
back room of Ludwig Schleger's saloon on
Second Avenue, and, because it was to be a busy
day and there were many pleas to be made and many
petitions to be received, he came early to his post.
</p>

<p>
As he swung majestically up the street toward his
destination, his carefully pressed light gray suit
flapping in the warm breeze about a figure so tall and
so thin that any suit approaching "a fit" would
have achieved only a caricature, his progress was
almost regal.  Pedestrians stepped to one side as if
the bulk of his unseen dignity demanded a far wider
strip of the paved channel than was required by his
visible physique.  Workingmen touched their grimy
caps, the overseers of the street-repairing gangs
bowed respectfully, children on their way to school
bobbed their heads, and, at a corner, Officer Riley,
concluding a substitute week "on the day turn,"
offered his best military salute.  The keeper of every
news-stand received a nod; the bootblacks outside of
each saloon were given a brief word of greeting;
there was not a beggar but got some largess, and
of the several men that hurried up with a request,
hinted or expressed, all were permitted to walk a
few steps in the august presence, all received a brief,
civil phrase of agreement, postponement, or consideration.
</p>

<p>
"Trouble about your place?"  It was thus that
O'Malley interrupted the voluble plea of a saloon-keeper
that approached him.  "I'll have that cop,
Conners, looked into.  His eyes are too new; they
see more'n they're paid to see.  Who's tendin'
day-bar for you?  Johnny Mager?  All right, if they
take the thing up front, I'll see that you get your
license transferred in his name.  Keep your shirt on
an' leave it to me."
</p>

<p>
He had not paused in his walk; he had not raised
his quiet voice or quickened his slow speech; but
the suppliant retired satisfied, reassured.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, O'Malley's face was one that, if it would
not inspire confidence in a stranger unacquainted with
the man's reputation for guarding the interests of
his dependents, at least bore the unmistakable stamp
of that knowledge of life which is power.  It was
sallow and long, with a long thin nose and long thin
lips, and cold eyes that thrust as swiftly and as deeply
as the stilettos of Mr. O'Malley's Italian constituents.
He smiled often and his smile was bitter;
he spoke little and his words were short; but his
servants had early learned that he was as sure to
keep his promise as he was ready to give it, and
that, so long as his tasks were well done, he was an
indulgent master.
</p>

<p>
He entered "Schleger's place" with the air of
an owner, nodded to the white-jacketed man behind
the polished counter and before the polished mirror,
and gave a quick, firm pressure to the plump,
outstretched hand of the fat and grinning proprietor.
</p>

<p>
"All well with the family?" he asked, smiling
his wry smile.
</p>

<p>
Ludwig Schleger beamed assent.
</p>

<p>
"Anything doing last night?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothin'," replied Ludwig.  "'Ceptin' Mr. Dyker
called you on the telephone.  Wouldn't say
what he wanted."
</p>

<p>
"I know that.  Haven't had any more roughhousing?"
</p>

<p>
"No," grinned Schleger, wisely; "the boys are all
got wise that they can't meddle with my new night-man."
</p>

<p>
"I see.  Name's Hermann Hoffmann, ain't it?"
</p>

<p>
"That's right."
</p>

<p>
"Hum.  Well, he may be useful.  You must get
him to move into this precinct, or else register him
from here.  Votes right, of course?"
</p>

<p>
"I ain't asked him yet."
</p>

<p>
"Do it to-night."
</p>

<p>
O'Malley walked to the dimly lighted back-room,
hung with racing prints and framed lithographs
advertising a wide variety of whiskeys.  He drew a
wicker-bottomed chair to a stained round table, and
sat down.
</p>

<p>
The proprietor brought him a glass and a syphon
of seltzer&mdash;the boss's only drink&mdash;and disappeared.
The bar-keeper came with a handful of black cigars
for which O'Malley paid with a bill, refusing the
change, and also disappeared.  Then the door of
communication was shut and guarded, admission being
denied to all persons not properly accredited, and
the quiet, thin man in the light gray suit, now sipping
his seltzer, now reflectively adjusting his bright
blue tie, which bore a brilliant diamond pin, and
always slowly smoking, began his conference with
such callers as he had granted appointments.
</p>

<p>
They came in force&mdash;alone and in groups&mdash;all
manner of men by the main entrance and a woman
or two ushered through a side door.  This one was
promised a reward for duty to be done, that one
assigned to the performance of a delicate piece of
diplomacy.  Now and then a short, sharp, cold
reprimand for negligence or failure sent away a caller
whipped, penitent, trembling; and here and there
release was promised for a wayward son sent to
"The Island," or a line of credit written for use
at a grocer's shop.
</p>

<p>
Wesley Dyker came early.  He paused at the bar
for a drink to stiffen his courage, lingered a little
longer until a predecessor had been dismissed, and
then, his lids lowered, entered, alone, with a succinct
account of Rose's attempt to play a double game.
</p>

<p>
When he had finished the narrative, O'Malley sat
for a while gazing unconcernedly at the blackened
ceiling, and smoking quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" he said at last, and turned the sharp
thrust of his gaze upon his caller.
</p>

<p>
Dyker, who was sitting opposite and who had
been served with a drink of whiskey, tossed off the
liquor in order to gain time to muster an answer for
this unexpected query.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he at length replied, annoyed at thus
being put into a position where he must make his
proposition in the form of a request, "are you going
to stand for that sort of thing?"
</p>

<p>
"I dunno."
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> wouldn't stand for it," said Dyker.
</p>

<p>
"If you had my job you might have to."
</p>

<p>
There was another pause.  The long fingers of
O'Malley tapped gently on the table.  Dyker shifted
uneasily in his seat.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't stand for it a minute!" he at last
broke forth.  "And what's more, you can have her
up for something worse than the disorderly-house
charge.  She has one kidnapped girl in her house
now, and I've got another that escaped from her,
and who's ready to testify."
</p>

<p>
An instant later he was sorry that he had spoken
so readily.
</p>

<p>
O'Malley tilted back against the wall until the
front legs of his chair rose six inches from the floor.
He blew an easy ring of smoke.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have come here with your case all
prepared," he remarked.
</p>

<p>
Wesley flushed and stammered.
</p>

<p>
"You see," he began, "I mean that I got hot
at this, and I said to myself that it was only right
to let you know this woman wasn't to be depended
upon."
</p>

<p>
The forward legs of O'Malley's chair came down
with a loud thump.  Wesley started, but the boss
only impaled him with another cold glance.
</p>

<p>
"See here," said he, "before we can do business
we'd better altogether understand each other.  Just
what is it you want?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I think I've made that clear."
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> think not."
</p>

<p>
"I want this Légère woman pinched for running
a white-slave place.  I want to see her taught a
lesson that the other women down her way will profit
by."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you do.  But what do you want for yourself?"
</p>

<p>
The issue was too conclusively joined to permit of
further evasion.  Wesley took his courage in his
hands.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I've not made any secret of that," he said,
"and neither has headquarters.  I want the next
election for magistrate.  I told you that long
ago."
</p>

<p>
He launched his declaration with the bravado of
weakness at bay, and then breathlessly awaited the
answer.
</p>

<p>
Michael O'Malley leaned back again in his chair,
clasped his hands behind his head, and closed his
keen eyes, reflecting.
</p>

<p>
His was an hereditary office, but, unlike most men
that inherit power, he had inherited also the abilities
that had gained the power.  His father, who had
begun life as a policeman, had been a great exemplar
of the political uses of an element fully realized only
by the expert politician: the human element.  The
name of O'Malley had now for a generation been,
south of Fourteenth Street, a magic title.  To a
legion of men, women, and children, it stood for
a sort of substitute, and very near and practical,
Providence.  It implied contact, fellow-feeling, the
personal relation.  Acting upon the politician's axiom
that whatever is acquired is right, the elder O'Malley
had risen from the street force until, after zealous
party-work, he had been promoted, in the palmy
days of policy and the pool-rooms, to the "Gambling
Squad," where he had performed the astounding
financial feat of saving eight times his monthly
salary, had retired, and grown annually richer and
stronger through politics, without once losing the
esteem of his voting underlings, or once seeming to
cease being one of them.  Since his father's death,
now that gambling had declined and prostitution had
risen as political material, Michael, who had been
brought up to the business, had filled the place of
that genuinely mourned parent.  Without any publicly
acknowledged means of support, even with no
headquarters save the daily shifted back-rooms of
saloons, he had extended and increased the power
and the fortune that had been left to him.  He was
known as the friend of the distressed; he was recognized
as benefiting with his left hand the poor whom
he unimpededly robbed with his right.  To those
who were without money or without assistance he
was always accessible.  He made festival with the
merry and was readily sympathetic with them that
mourned.  By small gifts at all times and large gifts
in days of emergency, by acting as the adviser, the
employment-agent, the defender, from the law, of
the people whom he exploited and upon whose
weaknesses and vices he throve, he won and held fast
both the tribute and the allegiance of the vicious and
the weak.
</p>

<p>
It was a mighty position and yet one that, in moments
like the present, was inherently delicate, one
in which the fortunate man must move warily lest
in gaining a new friend he lose an old.  It is all
very well to be temperate and profit by drunkenness,
to be abstemious and take money from prostitution;
it is easy to give presents at Christmas and picnics
in summer when the giving is in reality only paying
a small rebate to wives for drunken husbands, to
mothers for daughters stolen.  It is easy to find a
place in the municipal government for the man that
stuffs a ballot-box for you, or the procurer that
registers your fraudulent votes from the houses of his
customers; but it is fatal to punish, for what may
be a passing disloyalty, anyone that your world,
perhaps ignorant that offense has been committed,
regards as having been placed by a careless Heaven
under your protecting wing,&mdash;fatal, that is to say,
unless you acquire something more than you throw
away.
</p>

<p>
Of all this, though scarcely with such frankness
of phrase, Michael O'Malley made thought before
he gave Dyker the reply for which that clever young
lawyer was waiting.  Behind his closed eyes he
weighed the chances carefully: the things to be
gained against the things that might be lost.
</p>

<p>
Then he thoughtfully lit another black cigar.
</p>

<p>
"You've got to keep out of personal relations with
these women," he yawned.
</p>

<p>
Dyker bit his lip.
</p>

<p>
"I don't have them," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you do.  Cut 'em out.  Understand?"
</p>

<p>
Surprisedly, angrily, Dyker found himself bowing
obedience, like a school-urchin detected in some
breach of academic discipline.
</p>

<p>
"A woman with a past," continued O'Malley,
"is all right for the present, but a slow mare in the
futurity."
</p>

<p>
"I dare say you're correct," said Wesley Dyker.
With a single blow of the whip, the master had
demonstrated his mastery.
</p>

<p>
O'Malley smoked a while longer in silence.
</p>

<p>
"Now then," he at last pursued, "about this
magistracy.  You think the boys'll stand for you?"
</p>

<p>
"I think they will," Wesley replied, with humble
mien, but rising assurance.  "And I think it ought
to make the ticket look better to the uptown people
to have&mdash;if you will pardon my saying so&mdash;my sort
of name on it."
</p>

<p>
O'Malley grunted.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you worry about the looks of the ticket,
or the value of your sort of a name," he said.  "The
kid-glove game is played out; it's only the monkey
who's always hopping about on his family-tree."
</p>

<p>
Dyker's courage ebbed again, but he knew that
to stand upon his dignity was to be overthrown.
</p>

<p>
"At all events," he persisted, "I am pretty well
known hereabouts by this time, and I think honestly
that I am pretty well liked."
</p>

<p>
O'Malley nodded.  He knew more about that
than Dyker knew.  Dyker had, with more or less
direct assistance from O'Malley's own headquarters,
already won some prominence for himself, and had
been of some use to the organization, in that sort
of legal-practice which is a highly specialized branch
of the profession on the lower East Side.  The
purpose of that branch is simply the protection of the
criminal, especially the criminal engaged in the
procuring or confining of slave-girls, but its methods,
far from being unusual, are merely a daring extension
of the methods that, within the last decade, have
increased in popularity among the seemingly more
respectable practitioners.  Evidence is manufactured
or destroyed, according to immediate needs; favorable
witnesses are taught favorable testimony;
postponements are secured until a politically indebted
judge is on the bench.  There follows a formal
bellowing against what are called invasions of
inalienable personal rights, and then there comes a
matter-of-course acquittal.  With Dyker's ability in this
sort of work O'Malley was thoroughly familiar; for
this man's party-services he was sufficiently grateful,
and with the chance of the lawyer's rise to a
popularity that would be of still further help he was well
satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"If you'd be elected," he at length reflectively
remarked, "you'd have a mighty responsible
position, Dyker."
</p>

<p>
"I know that."
</p>

<p>
"There would be a good many ways"&mdash;O'Malley
knocked, with great deliberation, the ash from his
cigar&mdash;"a good many ways in which you could help
the party&mdash;if you'd be elected."
</p>

<p>
He seemed to be discussing, disinterestedly, a
purely abstract question; but Dyker did not miss his
meaning.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't overlook them," he said.
</p>

<p>
"And, <i>if you'd be elected</i>, there'd be a lot of ways
in which you might hurt&mdash;the party."
</p>

<p>
"I scarcely think you have any just cause for
apprehension upon that score, Mr. O'Malley.  I
think that my record speaks for itself.  My record
is regular; it is an open book to the whole city&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind that, Dyker; it's an open book to
me, anyhow."
</p>

<p>
"I'm aware of it; but then&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"All I want to know is two things."
</p>

<p>
"And they are, Mr. O'Malley?"
</p>

<p>
"First, are you the kind that lose their head over
a good thing and land in jail?"
</p>

<p>
"Does my law-practice seem to indicate that I
should be likely to overstep legal limits?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I guess it don't.  But you can't always tell;
we can't afford no hogs; and that sort of a man
gives all his friends a black eye."
</p>

<p>
"But I say to you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And next, I want to know, Mr. Dyker, whether
you're the kind of a man that don't forget them that
put him where he's at."
</p>

<p>
The low, slow spoken sentence ended with a sudden
click of Mr. O'Malley's long, vulpine jaws.  He
leaned quickly forward across the table and fixed
Wesley with the stiletto of his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Dyker met that gaze steadily.  He leaned, in his
turn, toward O'Malley, and his own voice dropped
to a whisper.  There was an exchange of a dozen
sentences, and the two men had arrived at a perfect
understanding: Dyker was as good as elected.
</p>

<p>
O'Malley pressed the call-button.
</p>

<p>
"Billy," he said to the bar-keeper, "have somebody
run out and bring in Larry Riley off his beat.
I want to see him."
</p>

<p>
As the bar-keeper nodded and disappeared, Dyker
started to rise.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know whether Riley had better see me
here," he said.  "Rose's house is on his regular
beat."
</p>

<p>
"All the more reason to sit tight," replied the
comprehending O'Malley.  "What's the use of gettin'
square with a person unless the person knows
who done it?"
</p>

<p>
"But I am not sure that Riley would be a safe
man to confide this to.  He's naturally a friend of
Rose's."
</p>

<p>
"He's more of a friend of mine."
</p>

<p>
The officer entered a minute later, his flushed face
gravely attentive, his helmet in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Riley," said O'Malley, "you know this Légère
woman."
</p>

<p>
"I do that, Mr. O'Malley, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Well, she's been gettin' too gay.  When you
go off duty, you tell Jim to have her place pinched
to-night."
</p>

<p>
Riley's cheeks became a shade less red.
</p>

<p>
"It's sorry I am to hear, sir, that she's been
misbehavin' of herself," he murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Sure you're sorry.  Tell Jim to get there early:
we don't want nobody but the women."
</p>

<p>
"What"&mdash;Riley wet his dry lips&mdash;"What's the
charge?"
</p>

<p>
"Runnin' a white-slave joint.  You're to be sure
to get a girl she has in the third floor back."
</p>

<p>
O'Malley's tone had been conclusive; it indicated
that the interview was at an end; but the big officer
stood twirling his helmet between his large hands.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. O'Malley, sir?" he began.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Riley?"
</p>

<p>
"There's nothin' else?"
</p>

<p>
"Nuthin'."
</p>

<p>
"An'&mdash;there ain't no other way out of it for
Mrs. Légère?"
</p>

<p>
"No, there ain't.  But you can report her house
and get the credit yourself, Riley."
</p>

<p>
"Thank ye kindly, sir; but if ye don't mind, sir,
I think I'd rather let someone get it as nades it more.
Ye see, Mr. O'Malley, sir, this here Mrs. Légère
has been powerful kind to me, an'&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"All right, have it your own way."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I can't do nothin' for her, Mr. O'Malley?"
</p>

<p>
"Not this time.  That's all, Riley.&mdash;And,
Riley&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The thin boss stood up and crossed to the bulky
policeman.  His voice was still low and soft.
</p>

<p>
"Yis, Mr. O'Malley?"
</p>

<p>
"If that woman gets wind of this an' makes
a getaway, I'll have your uniform off you so
God damned quick you'll wish I'd skinned you
alive."
</p>

<p>
"Yis, Mr. O'Malley, sir," said the officer.  "No
fear of that, sir."
</p>

<p>
But he left the audience-chamber with a heavy
heart.  He lived the life that he was compelled to
live, and he did what he was ordered to do, but he
could not without compunction turn upon one that
had bought a right to his own and his superior's
protection.
</p>

<p>
There was not a little silent bitterness in his heart
as, later, returning to the station-house, he thought
upon these things.  He remembered the days when
he had been new upon the force.  Those were the
days when the popular tide had turned against
gambling and, amid the raids that meant the breaking
of steel doors, the pursuit of offenders through
secret passages and across steep roofs, it was for a
while possible for a policeman to retain his ideals.
But he remembered also how, when the ruling powers
had thus been forced to destroy the nests where once
they had gathered golden eggs, the long arm of
necessity swung slowly backward until it paused at
the point where it had since remained and, because
the eggs must be gathered somewhere, the police
were expected to gather them from the aeries of the
vultures that preyed upon women.
</p>

<p>
Riley had not minded, every pay-day, handing
over to the appointed heeler the five dollars
wherefor he received a receipt for a dollar and a half
as dues to the political club to which he was
expected to belong.  For quite some time he had been
content with closing his eyes to saloons that were
opened on Sundays by proprietors that were powerful,
and with allowing others to profit by the rewards
of his voluntary blindness.  But at last there
came the first baby in the Riley home, and then the
second, and the wife's long illness; and then
assessments were increased and, finally, after many a
broad hint from the men higher up, he was given
plainly to understand that he must either hand over
a goodly portion of money, every week, from the
offending women on his beat, or else lose his
usefulness to the force.
</p>

<p>
After that, he took what he must and kept what
he could.  He had no trade on which to fall back;
his domestic and political expenses grew annually,
and, as an evasion of the former meant financial
ruin, so the shirking of the latter meant a charge
lodged at headquarters, a speedy hearing, and an
automatic dismissal.  Even when a non-partisan man
was put at the head of the department, that official's
practical power was nullified by the fact that the
mayor, a party-man, was behind him and could
remove him at a moment's notice, and that behind the
mayor was the organization that had made and could
break the mayor.  No individual, so far as Officer
Riley could see, was personally to blame, was
himself a free agent; but the whole collection of
individuals were the irresponsible parts of a gigantic
machine&mdash;from the inner council of Tammany to
their spies in every municipal department&mdash;which, if
ever broken by the recognized party of opposition,
must be so thoroughly rebuilt and so precisely
operated in accordance with mechanical lines that the
change would signify only the casting out of the
irresponsible parts and their replacement by parts
equally irresponsible.  Riley could look no farther,
and, even could he have seen that the remedy must
be a remedy of conditions, he could have done nothing
to free himself.
</p>

<p>
At the station-house he delivered the commands
that O'Malley had given him.  There his words
produced consternation, but no thought of disaffection.
The patrol-wagon was ordered to be in its stable,
ready to leave at the given hour, and Riley, as the
officer regularly assigned to night-work on the beat
in which stood Rose's house, was forced to remain
to accompany it.
</p>

<p>
"An' see here, you men,"&mdash;these were the words
with which the brief instructions were concluded&mdash;"you
see to it nobody gets ahead of you.  This is
O'Malley's job, an' it's got to be done right."
</p>

<p>
In the underworld of every city, news, however,
travels even while it is in the making, and in no
direction does it travel more swiftly, just as in no
other does it travel more indirectly, than, when the
slave-trade is concerned, it travels to the traders.
Riley was careful to remain in full view of the
sergeant's desk from the moment the arrangements were
made until the time of execution&mdash;he would not have
dared to communicate with the friends that had thus
swiftly become the enemy&mdash;none of the wagon-crew
were seen to leave the stable, to use the telephone,
or to speak to a passerby, and yet, shortly before
the appointed time, through a certain club-room over
a not far distant saloon&mdash;a club-room much affected
by young men in Max Grossman's profession&mdash;there
soon spread the definite tidings that Rosie Légère
had just been "piped off."
</p>

<p>
The swarthy and brilliant Rafael Angelelli heard
the word, and straightway, beyond all doubting,
confirmed it.  With the unheeded easy evening breeze
tumbling his uncovered oily locks, he ran to the
nearest booth-telephone, and hurriedly called Rose upon
the wire.
</p>

<p>
"Eet ees comin'!" he whispered excitedly into
the transmitter.
</p>

<p>
Rose's voice replied with stolid assurance.
</p>

<p>
"What's comin'?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Poliziotti</i>&mdash;cops," replied the Italian, finding
more and more difficulty with his English as his
panic increased.  "Eet ees Angel talkin'.&mdash;I jus'
getta da <i>nuova</i>.&mdash;They maka da pinch!"
</p>

<p>
"Quit your kiddin'."
</p>

<p>
"Naw.  <i>Veraménte.  Crêdi tu!</i>  Queeck!"
</p>

<p>
His fright hit the mark.
</p>

<p>
"How'd it happen?" demanded Rose.  "Who's
back of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Dees Meest' Dyker."
</p>

<p>
"You fool Dago"&mdash;her voice grew shrill with
fear and anger&mdash;"can't you do nothin'?"
</p>

<p>
"Naw.  'E's been to O'Malley."
</p>

<p>
"You're a hell of a help!  How about Riley an'
the rest?"
</p>

<p>
"Naw.  O'Malley maka them do thees."
</p>

<p>
"It's that slut Violet, that's who it is!  That's
gratitude for you.  I've been half expectin' trouble
since she got loose last night.&mdash;How long have I?"
</p>

<p>
"I don' know.  Maybe five min'; maybe one."
</p>

<p>
"My Gawd!"
</p>

<p>
"Don' hang up!  Leesten: firs' t'eeng you do getta
da new girl out.  Eef they getta dees new girl you
go&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But there came a quick click from the other end
of the wire.  Rose had ended the conversation.
</p>

<p>
Angel, still hatless, hurried through the few
intervening streets and darted into that street to which
he had just been speaking.
</p>

<p>
Already the early New York twilight had descended,
and the block seemed, at first glance, to
have turned to slumber.  One distant, spluttering
arc-light succeeded only in accentuating the gloom.
From the patch of darkening sky into which the
roofs blended, a bare handful of pale stars twinkled
weakly, and on both sides, from corner to corner,
the uniform, narrow houses rose in somber repetition,
each with its brief, abrupt flight of steps, each with
its shuttered windows, each silent behind its mask.
</p>

<p>
All this the Italian saw with accustomed eyes, and
then he darted into the shadow of an areaway, because
he saw also that, brief as had been his journey,
Riley had arrived before him.
</p>

<p>
In a little knot of wise children, a patrol wagon,
its sophisticated horses unconcernedly dozing, stood
before Rose's house.  An officer was in the doorway;
hurried lights shifted from behind one bowed shutter
to another, and gradually Angel became conscious
that, all along the street, frightened faces were
peeping from stealthily lifted blinds.
</p>

<p>
For quite some time the watcher waited.  At last
the big figure of Riley and a companion appeared in
the open doorway and spoke to someone in the
wagon.  Through the evening quiet their voices came
distinctly.
</p>

<p>
"Ready?" asked Riley.
</p>

<p>
"All ready," came the answer.
</p>

<p>
"We've got the madam an' the nigger, an' the
four of thim, but I belave they must have turned the
new girl loose before we got here."
</p>

<p>
This time the reply came from within the house,
and it came in the tones of Rose, raised high in
anger and in blasphemy:
</p>

<p>
"You're a dirty liar, Larry Riley!  There never
was another one, an' you know that as well as I
do!  Just you wait till I tell the judge what you do
know, you damned, low, double-crossin' sneak!  You
bastard, you!"
</p>

<p>
Riley and his companions turned and ran into the
vestibule.
</p>

<p>
"Just you wait," the cry continued.  "Just you
wait, you thief, you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The voice stopped as suddenly as it had started.
</p>

<p>
There was another pause, a longer one, and then
Angel, bending as far as he dared from his hidden
corner, saw the two officers come quickly out with
their hands upon the arms of two cloaked women,
whom they helped into the dark recesses of the
patrol-wagon.  They went back and returned with
one more.  A fourth followed; then a fifth, and a
sixth.  Two policemen appeared, evidently from
positions that they had been guarding in the rear
of the house.  The man on the steps closed the door
and locked it.  All the policemen climbed to the
wagon.  The driver gathered up the reins.  The
tittering children scattered wildly.  The horses woke
up and started away at a brisk trot.
</p>

<p>
Impartial Justice was beginning her task.

<br><br>
SANCTUARY
</h3>

<p>
To leave the protection of Dyker and the
kindly secrecy of the cab, and then to leap
into a tide of alien human beings and swim
against them in a strange and terrifying sea, had
required the last grain of courage and strength that
was left in Violet's sapped body and cowed soul.
It was only by the momentum that Wesley's calm
directions had given her, and quite without
consciousness upon her own part that, with her cloak
gripped tightly about her, she tottered forward,
buffeted and shrinking, to the first corner, wheeled to
the right into a street comfortingly darker, turned
again into a still narrower and quieter way, and then
came to an uncertain stop before what seemed to
be no street at all, but only a small black rift among
the beetling walls of brick.
</p>

<p>
Empty as was the way compared with Rivington
Street, it was what, had she not seen the former
thoroughfare, she would have considered oppressively
full.  Urchins walked hand in hand along the gutters,
push-cart men cried their wares over the cobbles
and, in the hot night, frowzy women crowded the
house-steps.  A clatter of voices, of foreign tongues
and unfamiliar forms of English, rattled out the
gossip of the neighborhood, and a few steps away,
a belated hurdy-gurdy shook forth a popular tune.
</p>

<p>
Violet cowered against the nearest wall.  She was
uncertain as to how to proceed, and she was afraid
to stand still.  There seized her an unreasoned terror
lest all this seeming escape might be some new trick
leading into some new trap.  A policeman passed
with heavy tread, but, unmindful of Dyker's assurance,
the girl drew, trembling, as far away from
him as she could.  Then, when her straining eyes
saw him turn at the next corner to retrace his steps,
she made sure that he was coming back to recapture
her, and, now desperate, she faced a pair of solemn
children slowly approaching from the opposite
direction.
</p>

<p>
The six-year-old boy to whom she especially
addressed herself shook an uncomprehending head, but
his wiser companion, a very dirty little girl of seven,
made proud answer.
</p>

<p>
"He don't to speak no English," she said.  "He
only can tell things out of Jewish.  But I tells you.
That there's your street right behind you.  Yiss,
ma'am.  An' your house is by the two on that there
side."
</p>

<p>
Violet's lips tried to form a word of thanks.  She
turned, as the girl had ordered, into the rift among
the brick walls, found that, once it had traveled
beyond the depth of the house before which she had
been standing, it opened to a width of a few
additional feet, and so, almost creeping through the
Stygian passage in which shone only one far-away
lamp, she felt her way to the second door.
</p>

<p>
It was partially open, and a jet of blue gas in the
hallway burned overhead.  She could see several
doors in the shadows, but all were closed.  She heard
a dragging step coming down the stairs.  She drew
against the wall and waited.
</p>

<p>
The step was slow and uncertain.  It seemed to
consider well before each movement forward, but it
had a character that reassured her.  It was the same
sort of step with which her father was wont to
return home after his occasional carouses, and she
knew that whoso walked in that fashion was, so
long as one kept out of reach, not greatly to be
feared.  She remained hidden until the step drew
nearer, until the dark bulk of the drunkard slowly
massed itself out of the surrounding darkness, until
it had brushed by her.  Then she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Can you tell me," she asked, "if there's a Miss
Flanagan lives here?"
</p>

<p>
The passerby was not in a condition where voices
from nowhere seemed remarkable.  He stopped
and, evidently not clear as to just whence this
particular voice proceeded, addressed the air
immediately before him.
</p>

<p>
"I can so," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Then will you, please?"
</p>

<p>
"Will I what?" responded the passerby, determined
that the air should be more specific.
</p>

<p>
"Will you please <i>tell</i> me?"
</p>

<p>
"Tell you what?"
</p>

<p>
"Is there a Miss Flanagan lives here?"
</p>

<p>
"There is that.  There's three of her, an' wan of
thim's a Missus.  Good-night."
</p>

<p>
Awkwardly he touched his hat to the air and
stumbled out into the alley.
</p>

<p>
Violet breathed hard.  She had never in her life
before been in a tenement-house; but she knew that
now she must seek a door through which some ray
of light gave hint of waking persons within and,
knocking, of them inquire anew.  Around her, all
the doors were forbidding, so, timidly and with a
hand tight upon the shaking rail, she softly climbed
the decrepit stairs.
</p>

<p>
At the second floor a shaft of yellow light stopped
her.
</p>

<p>
Here was a door that was open, and beyond it,
by an uncovered deal table on which stood a rude
kerosene lamp, sat two figures: the figure of an old
woman, her gnarled hands clasped loosely in her
aproned lap, her dim eyes gazing at the sightless
window, and the figure of a young woman, her hands
beneath her round chin, her wide eyes on a naked
baby quietly sleeping in a clothes-basket at her knee.
The floor was uncarpeted, the walls unadorned, the
room almost bare of furniture; but on the face of
her that looked into the past and in the face of her
that looked into the future there was peace.
</p>

<p>
A quick stroke of pain stabbed the onlooker's
heart, but she dragged herself ahead and, not to
disturb the baby, spoke without knocking.
</p>

<p>
The old woman turned, and Violet noticed that
the eyes which could see so far behind were blind
and could see no step forward.  The mother,
however, spoke kindly and gave the directions that the
girl needed; but Violet, wanting to say something
about the baby in return, and, able only to murmur
formal thanks, pursued her climb upward.
</p>

<p>
She found at last the door that she was certain
must be Katie Flanagan's, but, when she had found
it, all power of further motion suddenly ceased.
Weakness, shame, and fear swept over her like a
cloud of evil gases from an endangered mine, and
she swayed against the panel before her.
</p>

<p>
Inside, Katie and the shirtwaist-maker, just ready
for bed, heard the faint sound without and, opening
the door, caught the almost fainting figure in their
arms.  The dark cloak dropped open, disclosing the
crimson kimona beneath, and this, awakening Violet's
one dominating passion&mdash;the terror of detection
and consequent recapture&mdash;roused the fugitive a
little.  She staggered away from the assisting hands,
wrapped the cloak tightly around her, and leaned,
panting, against the wall.
</p>

<p>
"Miss&mdash;Miss Flanagan?" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
Katie nodded her black head.
</p>

<p>
"That's me," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I'm&mdash;I'm the&mdash;I'm Violet."
</p>

<p>
The Irish girl comprehended quickly.  With Irish
tact she refused, just then, to hear more; with Irish
volubility she burst into exclamations of pity, and
with ready Irish sympathy she took Violet in her
strong arms.
</p>

<p>
"Put her on my cot," said Carrie, and they led
her there.
</p>

<p>
They took away her cloak, for she was now too
weak to protest, and, though they did pause in awe
before the crimson kimona, they hurried to make
their guest comfortable.  The Lithuanian Jewess
moved silently and swiftly about with that calm
competence which characterizes her people, and
Katie, fanning the white face and chafing the thin
hands, continued to croon condolences.
</p>

<p>
"There now!" she at last smiled, as Violet's blue
eyes opened.  "Sure you're yourself again entirely.
Don't say a word, not one word, an' just tell us
whatever 'tis you might be wantin'."
</p>

<p>
"Whiskey," gasped Violet.
</p>

<p>
The girls looked at each other.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," said the Jewess, quietly; "I
can spare it"&mdash;and she handed Katie some small
change.
</p>

<p>
The Irish girl flung a shawl over her head, and
ran down the stairs.  She went into the side door of
the nearest saloon, entered a narrow compartment,
passed the money through a hole in a partition, and
was given a small flask partly filled.  Within five
minutes she had returned, and Violet, drinking the
contents of the bottle at a single draught, began to
revive.
</p>

<p>
"Are you hungry, darlin'?" asked Katie.
</p>

<p>
Violet shook her russet head.
</p>

<p>
"No," she answered, "I couldn't eat, thanks.
I'm only just played out."
</p>

<p>
"Poor dear, you look it.  But you're all right
now, an' you can rest as long as you like.  Don't you
bother.  Don't you worry.  Don't you be afraid.
You got away without any trouble, did you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Violet, and because she was still
unable to frame her lips to adequate thanks, she gave
them as much of the story of her escape as she could
give without mention of the name of her rescuer,
who had warned her that he must not be publicly
known to figure in the case.
</p>

<p>
"A man?" echoed the cynical Katie.  "An' he
didn't ask nothin' in return?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"He must be worth knowin', that man."
</p>

<p>
"He only wants me to go somewhere an' swear to
all Rose done to me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"&mdash;Katie's tone showed that she could now
account for the gentleman's generosity.&mdash;"Well,
don't you do it."
</p>

<p>
But Violet could not follow her.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know just why; but don't you do it."
</p>

<p>
"I promised," said Violet.
</p>

<p>
"Och, listen to the poor dear!" Katie appealed
to her fellow-lodger.  "I wonder is it long she
thinks he'd be keepin' his word to her."
</p>

<p>
Her own word freshened the ever-abiding terror
in the runaway's heart, but Violet said no more
about it.
</p>

<p>
"Would you have much to swear to?" asked
Carrie, seated on the foot of the cot.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" Violet parried.
</p>

<p>
"She means, Violet&mdash;&mdash;" began Katie.
</p>

<p>
The fugitive, in her new surroundings, shrank
from the name.
</p>

<p>
"Don't!  Don't call me that!" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Sure an' ain't it the name you gave me yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"I know, but I don't want to hear it ever again.
Call me Mary; call me Mary&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And there, face to face with a new danger, Violet
came to a stop.  Her captivity had taught her much
of bestiality, but it had taught her besides only that
some unknown, tremendous power hated her; that
she was debased and must never, at whatever cost of
further suffering to herself, permit her degradation
to attach to her family; that she must escape, but
that she must also wholly divorce herself from all
that life had meant her to be.  She had no thought
of the future; she had only a realization of what
had been and what was.
</p>

<p>
"Mary what?" asked Carrie.
</p>

<p>
"Mary Morton," lied Violet.  Perhaps she had
heard the name before; perhaps the easy alliteration
brought it first to her mind.  At all events, she
reflected, one name was as good as another, so long
as it was not her own.
</p>

<p>
"Would you have much to swear to?" Carrie
was continuing.  "Is it as bad as they say&mdash;there?"
</p>

<p>
Violet looked at the round, serious face before her.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what they say," she replied; "but
it's worse than anybody can say.  There's a lot of
it you can't say, because there's a lot of it there ain't
no words ever been made up for.  Just you pray
God you won't ever have to find out how bad it is."
</p>

<p>
They looked at her and saw on her the marks of
which she was not yet aware.
</p>

<p>
Katie bent over and swiftly kissed the fevered
forehead under its tumbled russet hair.
</p>

<p>
"You poor woman," she said with unintended
implication, "an' how many years did you have to
stand it?"
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't years; it was&mdash;it was only weeks."
</p>

<p>
"What?  An' they could get a grown woman like you?"
</p>

<p>
Violet tried to smile.
</p>

<p>
"How old do you think I am?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
Katie made what she considered a charitable reply.
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-five?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not seventeen."
</p>

<p>
Katie began to busy herself about the room, and
Carrie turned her head.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well," said Katie, "you're tired out, an'
it's 'most mornin'.  We must all go to sleep now."
</p>

<p>
"I only put on long dresses in April," said Violet.
</p>

<p>
But Katie seemed not to hear her.  She hurried
the arrangements for the night.
</p>

<p>
"Sleep as long as you like in the morning," said
Carrie; "and if you can wear any of our things,
wear 'em.  We have to get up early, but don't mind
us."
</p>

<p>
The latter injunction was unnecessary.  Though
Violet had for some time been excited by her escape,
that excitement had already given place to utter
exhaustion.  The lamp had scarcely been extinguished
before, with throbbing head, she passed into a sleep
that was almost coma, and the lamp that was burning
when she opened her aching eyes was the lamp
of midmorning.
</p>

<p>
She was alone and afraid to be alone.  Her head
seemed splitting.  She saw the milk and rolls that
Katie had set out for her on the oilcloth-covered
table, but her stomach revolted at the thought of
food, and her poisoned nerves cried out for alcohol.
She got up and managed to pull on some of the
clothes belonging to her two hostesses.
</p>

<p>
From her first glance at the mirror, she drew
back in bewilderment.  During all her imprisonment
she had been used, through her gradual change, to
compare her morning appearance with that of her
fellow slaves; but now there was fresh in her mind
the standard, not of those pale and worn, though
often fat and hardened, convicts, but of the pair
of healthy girls that had, the night before, sheltered
her; and from that standard her very image in the
glass seemed to withdraw in horror.  Lacking rouge,
her cheeks, once so pink and firm, were pasty and
pendant; her lips hung loose, her blue eyes were dull
and blurred; even her hair appeared colorless and
brittle.  Little lines had formed at the corners of
her eyes; her skin seemed rough and cracked, and
other lines were already faintly showing from her
nostrils to the corners of her mouth.
</p>

<p>
She sat down on the cot, sick and shivering.
When she noticed a small pile of bedding in the
corner behind the gas-stove, she shook at the memory
of another such pile on another terrible morning,
and by the time she had realized that one of her
friends must have slept there in order to provide an
extra couch, she was too wracked by suffering, physical
and mental, to feel, at once, any great gratitude.
The fever throbbed in her wrists, beat in her heart,
hammered in her brain.  She did not dare go to
the street for whiskey or medicine.  At every sound
on the stairs she started up in the assurance that her
keepers had come to recover her, and when, in the
early afternoon, a loud knocking sounded on the
door, she fell, in unresponding silence, before
Katie's flaring lithograph of Our Lady of the
Rosary.
</p>

<p>
"Hello in there!" called a not overcautious voice.
"I want to talk to Miss Violet!"
</p>

<p>
Violet raised her clasped hands to the printed face
before her.
</p>

<p>
"Don't let them take me!" she whispered in a
prayer to that visible sign of a power she had never
before addressed.  "Don't let them take me!"
</p>

<p>
"Open up, can't you?" the voice insisted.  "I
know there's somebody inside, an', honest, I'm not
going to hurt you!"
</p>

<p>
Violet's hands fell.  The voice, she realized, was
at least unfamiliar.
</p>

<p>
"Come on," it wheedled.  "I'm all right; I'm
from Mr. Dyker."
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"He said Miss Violet would know," came the
answer.  "He said I would be expected&mdash;that it'd
be all right if I just told you I came from him."
</p>

<p>
Violet had not forgotten Katie's warning, but she
was unable wholly to doubt the one man that had
befriended her.  She opened the door.
</p>

<p>
The pink-and-white young clerk that entered was
much embarrassed, and his hostess, in her fever, did
not ease him.  Nevertheless, after many hesitations
on his own part, and more repetitions and explanations
made necessary by Violet, he at last convinced
her that he did indeed come from Wesley Dyker,
and that there was waiting around the corner the
cab that would convey her to an office where she
could begin the redemption of her pledge.
</p>

<p>
Almost in a dream, and too ill now much to care
what happened to her, she followed the messenger.
Dazedly she greeted Dyker in the cab; confusedly
she left that conveyance for an office where she
answered interminable questions put to her by another
young man who, she was told, was an Assistant District
Attorney; vaguely she heard Dyker assure this
official, as she affixed a signature to an offered paper,
that Wesley would himself guarantee her appearance
whenever it was required, and when she was
at last wheeled back and had climbed the stairs and,
alone, fallen again upon Carrie's cot, the only one
of recent facts concerning which she was at all
certain was that she had said she was a native
of Pittsburgh and that her name was Mary
Morton.
</p>

<p>
Katie and Carrie, returning together, found her
flushed and babbling nonsense.  When they
approached her, she did not recognize them, and then,
for an hour, they could get from her only the
monotonous repetition:
</p>

<p>
"Don't let them get me!  Don't tell them my name!"
</p>

<p>
It was eight o'clock before the patient, quieted
by sympathy and stimulated by whiskey, could be
taken to the nearest drugstore, and there, as soon
as the experienced druggist set eyes on her, he
refused to prescribe.
</p>

<p>
He beckoned Katie to a corner.
</p>

<p>
"That girl's got to go to a hospital," he said;
"and if I was you, I wouldn't lose much time in
getting her there."
</p>

<p>
Katie the competent lost none.  After another
drink to stifle possible protest, Violet was taken
upon a car to Sixteenth Street, and was then walked
quickly westward.  During all the way she did
not speak, and, when she reached the hospital's
fortunately empty receiving-ward, she was nearly
unconscious.
</p>

<p>
A white-capped nurse received the little party, the
young doctor, in shirt-sleeves and duck trousers,
hovering in the background among the glass shelves
agleam with instruments of polished steel.
</p>

<p>
"What's the trouble?" asked the nurse.
</p>

<p>
"It's that that we've come to find out of you,"
answered Katie.
</p>

<p>
The nurse nodded to the doctor.
</p>

<p>
He came forward and made a quick examination.
</p>

<p>
"Bring this woman inside and put her on the
table," he ordered.  "And you girls, stop where you
are."
</p>

<p>
Her head thrown back, her dry mouth wide, and
her russet hair falling, the unresisting Violet was
carried behind a door that shut smartly after
her.
</p>

<p>
Too scared to speak, Katie and her companion
stood outside.  Five minutes passed.  Then ten.
After a quarter of an hour, the door reopened.
</p>

<p>
"What's this patient's name?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Mary Morton," said Carrie.
</p>

<p>
"Where does she live?"
</p>

<p>
Katie gave her own address, and the doctor,
a pad of printed forms in hand, noted both the
answers.
</p>

<p>
That done, he paused and bit his pencil.
</p>

<p>
"Married?" he asked quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Who?" parried Katie.  "Me?"
</p>

<p>
"No; the patient."
</p>

<p>
"Well, now," began Katie, "I can't see as
that's&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But the calm voice of Carrie interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"She is married," she said.
</p>

<p>
The doctor pursed incredulous lips.
</p>

<p>
"Where's her husband?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
Katie, who had caught the need of the moment,
jumped into the breach.
</p>

<p>
"Where a lot of them are," she responded, "an'
where as many more might as well be, for all the
use they are to their poor wives."
</p>

<p>
"Where's that?"
</p>

<p>
"Faith, it's you, sir, ought to know: you're the
man."
</p>

<p>
"Dead?"
</p>

<p>
"Run away."
</p>

<p>
"Not much later than yesterday, did he?  Well,
I must find her nearest relative or friend.  Are you
either?"
</p>

<p>
Katie's face lengthened.
</p>

<p>
"Och, doctor," she said, "you don't mean
to&mdash;but it can't be that there's goin' to be a
baby!"
</p>

<p>
The young interne grinned.  Then, serious again,
he answered:
</p>

<p>
"No, there is not.  I only wish it was so simple.
Where are her folks?"
</p>

<p>
"She's none in the world, an' no money.  The
hard truth is, doctor, that it's a charity-patient she'll
have to be."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right; but are you her nearest friends?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, doctor."
</p>

<p>
"That'll do, I guess.  She's a nervous wreck&mdash;among
other things.  We've first of all got to get
her round from that condition, and then I'll have
to secure either her own or your permission, as her
nearest friends, to do something more."
</p>

<p>
"More?" repeated Katie.  "Ain't it bad enough
as it is?  What more do you mean to do to the
poor&mdash;girl?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't mean to do anything myself, but this is
a common enough kind of case around here to make
me certain what the resident surgeon will do: he'll
operate."

"A NET BY THE WAYSIDE"
</h3>

<p>
Hermann Hoffmann, passing one
evening to the little clothes-press behind the
bar in Ludwig Schleger's saloon, and putting
on the canvas coat that was his badge of office, heard
the voice of the proprietor calling his name, and
turned to see that stout German-American beckoning
him to enter the back-room where, a month before,
O'Malley had held with Wesley Dyker that conference
which had proved so disastrous to Rose Légère.
</p>

<p>
He walked through the open door, whistling his
Teutonic melody.  He had not that fear of his
employer which most employees have of the man for
whom they work.  Schleger had proved himself lenient
and good-natured, and Hermann, whose cheerful
round face and easy smile did not interfere with the
use of a knotted arm and a mighty fist, was quite
aware that there was no complaint justly to be made
against the manner in which he performed his alloted
tasks.
</p>

<p>
"Hoffmann," said Schleger, smiling, "you're all right."
</p>

<p>
"Sure," grinned Hermann.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," pursued the proprietor, "I been thinkin'
about you that you sure have made good."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad you vas sadisfied, Schleger."
</p>

<p>
"I am satisfied; but I think you need a little more
time off now an' then.  I haven't got nothin' to do
this evenin'.  I'll take your place."
</p>

<p>
Hermann's eyes brightened with unaffected pleasure.
It had not always been pleasant to work in the
nights when Katie was all day busy in the shop.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," nodded Schleger, benignantly; "it will
be like old times for me.  You take a night off."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I start out righd avay?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.&mdash;Of course you understand I'll want
you around here the day of the primaries."
</p>

<p>
Hermann nodded.
</p>

<p>
"And Hermann, there's somethin' else I've been
meanin' to talk to you about, and kep' forgettin' till
O'Malley reminded me of it again this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
Hoffmann, pulling off his white jacket, stopped
with arms extended.
</p>

<p>
"O'Malley?" he said in a strained voice.  "Vat's
dot man got to do vith me?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you know he don't miss no tricks nowheres,
an' some time back I was tellin' him what a
good man you was, an' he said we ought to get you
a little more active for him.  A fellow behind a bar
can do a whole lot that way, you know,&mdash;an' make a
good thing of it."
</p>

<p>
"I know," replied Hermann, ripping off the coat,
"but I ain't no politician."
</p>

<p>
"Nobody said you was, but all the fellows help a
little."
</p>

<p>
"Sure; only I don't."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  We want to do well for the slate this
time.  Wesley Dyker's on it; you know him; he's
all right."
</p>

<p>
"I ain't no politician, Schleger."
</p>

<p>
This stolid attitude plainly began to puzzle the
proprietor.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be a fool, Hoffmann," he said.  "The
boys all have their eye on you, an' O'Malley don't
forget any of his friends."
</p>

<p>
"Schleger, I got my own friends, und I make
my own friends.  I don't vant nussing I don't earn
from nobody."
</p>

<p>
"But that sort of thing won't look right," argued
Schleger.  "You see, you're registered from
here&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"No I ain't, Schleger; I'm registered from my
own blace."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I didn't know that; you didn't tell me,
an' so I registered you from here."
</p>

<p>
Hoffmann's pink cheeks became red.  He folded
his coat neatly over his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Vatch here, Schleger," he began.  "I ain't no
politician.  I don't care&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But he bit his lip and mastered himself to silence.
</p>

<p>
The proprietor saw this and appreciated the
self-control that it manifested.  There had been a time
when he had felt as Hermann felt now, and so he
was not disposed to use harsh argument.  He came
close to Hoffmann and, still smiling, dropped his
voice to a whisper.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," he said, soothingly.  "I guess
I know how you look at it.  Don't say that I said
so, but we'll let the matter drop if you only lay low
a little and keep quiet.  You know the brewery's
backin' me in this saloon, an' you know, with the
brewery pushin' me all the time for its money, I
couldn't run the place a month if I didn't keep the
side-door open Sundays.  Well, then, how could I
keep the place workin' Sundays if it wasn't for
O'Malley?  Just try not to be openly again' him,
that's all."
</p>

<p>
Hermann did not commit himself, but his tone
had softened when, in reply, he asked:
</p>

<p>
"Und should I take to-night off?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly you should.  Go along now, an' ferget it."
</p>

<p>
He went, but as he walked down the avenue,
"Die Wacht Am Rhein" issued from his lips to the
time of a funeral-march.
</p>

<p>
His sole consolation lay in the fact that, in the
recent glimpses he had secured of Katie, that young
lady had begun to evince signs of relenting from her
former attitude of celibacy.  He knew that she had
gradually ceased to descant upon the impossibility
of his supporting a wife, and he thought that she
was entertaining hopes of a promotion in the shop
to a position where her own earnings, added to his,
would make a comfortable living-wage for two.
</p>

<p>
What he did not know&mdash;and this for the excellent
reason that Katie would not tell it to him&mdash;was that,
whatever their prospects for the future, both Katie
and her roommate were still engaged in that battle
with poverty and temptation which had lessened
scarcely one whit since its beginning.  For the former
the fortunes of war were less than ever favorable,
and for the latter the most that was expected was
the maintenance of her stand in the face of every
armed reason to surrender or retreat.
</p>

<p>
The strike dragged along its wearied length.
Popular sympathy, which had aided the shirtwaist-makers
in their former rebellion, had lost its interest
in the cause, and, as the newspapers said less, the
employers became more demonstrative.  Hired thugs
guarded the factories and beat whatever young
women dared, by the simplest words, to plead, in
public, with the scab laborers.  When these battles
occurred the police, knowing well the interests of
their masters, arrested the mere girls for assault and
battery upon the thugs, forcing them to remain, if
detained, on benches with women old in immorality
and crime; and the magistrates before whom these
dangerous female criminals were hailed, not forgetting
which party to the suit could vote at the coming
election, would often send the offenders to the
Reformatory or the Island, where they could no longer
interfere, or would impose fines calculated still more
to deplete a strike-fund already pitiably shrunken.
Some of the unionists had already laid down their
arms and returned to the factories; more had gone
over to another enemy and disappeared beneath the
dark current of the underworld.  The rest&mdash;and
Carrie was among the number&mdash;must soon come face to
face with starvation.
</p>

<p>
Katie's difficulties, though as yet less physical,
were scarcely less poignant.  She found that she was
rarely left long in one portion of the Lennox shop.
From the chief woman's-hosiery department, she
was shifted, without warning, to the handkerchief
counter, and thence, again with no explanation, she
was sent to help in the main aisle at a table where
there was a special sale of stockings at reduced
prices.
</p>

<p>
At first these frequent shiftings appeared to result
from no apparent cause.  She was fined as much as
the other clerks, but no more than they, and she
could in no wise account for the changes.  But at
last she noticed that after a shift for the worse the
sacrosanct Mr. Porter would usually happen by and
open a conversation, and then she remembered that,
before such a shift, this same side-whiskered
gentleman had generally made overtures, and that
those overtures had not been well received.
The theory arising from these observations she
resolved to confirm.  After the next move she
made deliberate eyes at the man she detested,
and she was next day promoted, with a twenty-five
cent increase of pay per week, to the silk-stocking
counter.  From that day she saw her warfare
developing into a dangerous game of hide-and-seek in
which Mr. Porter was "It," and from that day
dated her increasing tendency to reconsider the
determination not to marry Hermann Hoffmann.
</p>

<p>
For Violet, meanwhile, the young interne's prophesy
had been fulfilled.  Four days after her admission
to the hospital there had been performed upon her
that operation which had been made necessary by
her servitude, but to which, had she been consulted,
her fears would never have allowed her to consent.
For three weeks she lay in her narrow bed among
other sufferers, and, when at last the fiction of
discharging her as "cured" had been accomplished,
and the five-cent carfare donated by the hospital to
charity-patients had been given, she had been met
by Katie and Carrie, and had tottered between them
to their room.
</p>

<p>
During another week she had now rested there.
Her eyes were still sunken, dull, dark-rimmed; her
cheeks white and transparently thin.  The knuckles
of her fingers seemed to have grown larger, and her
hands were nearly transparent.  But her lips, though
bloodless, had gained a new firmness.  Clearly or
deeply she could never think, without help from a
stronger and better mind; yet she had made what
use she might of her long leisure and had resolved,
more or less definitely, upon what she would do with
her life.
</p>

<p>
"I went out an' walked a block by myself yesterday,"
she confessed to her two friends early on the
evening of Hermann's political discussion with his
employer; "an' I didn't get any tired an' wasn't
hardly any scared.  Now I want you to take me for
a longer walk to-night an' then by to-morrow I'll be
all right."
</p>

<p>
They protested that she must not spur her
convalescence, but she was determined.  It was, she
knew, impossible for them much longer to support
her, and the last of her one ten-dollar bill had long
ago been spent.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you what we might do," Carrie at last
suggested.  "There's some sort of a concert over
at the settlement to-night.  We might go to that.
I used to know some of the ladies there, and there's
always a chance that they can get you a job."
</p>

<p>
While she was speaking Hermann's whistle, more
cheerful now than when he had left the saloon,
sounded on the stairs, and Katie, surprised and glad,
opened the door to his knock.
</p>

<p>
"Late to your work again," she said, with a smile
that belied her.  "How'll you ever be holdin' that
job, anyhow?"
</p>

<p>
The newcomer's only answer was a courageous
and unrebuked kiss.  He turned to Carrie.
</p>

<p>
"Vat you sink of such a vay of meetin' me?"
he appealed.  "My boss gives me a nighd off, und
I haf seen my girl not fur ten days und den&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused as his unrecognizing eye fell upon Violet.
</p>

<p>
"Egscuse me," he began.  "I didn't see&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Of course you didn't see it was your old friend
Violet that was an' Miss Morton that is," interrupted
Katie, with a quick desire to shield her charge.
"You're gettin' that near-sighted I wonder how you
can tell a whiskey-glass from a beer-stein."
</p>

<p>
Hermann hurried forward in rosy embarrassment
and saved Violet from rising.  He took her frail
hand in his big paw and poured out a tumbling
stream of polite lies upon the matter of her health.
</p>

<p>
"I guess it ain't quite as good as you say," replied
Violet; "but it soon will be.  Have you&mdash;I didn't
get no news while I was sick.  Have you heard
anything about&mdash;things?"
</p>

<p>
"You knew Rose's place was pinched?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Katie told me that."
</p>

<p>
"Well, dey had some trouble gettin' pail fur
her.  Everybody vas afraid fur to do it vith O'Malley
after her.  Still, dey vorked it somevays und
nobody thought but she'd jump it und run avay; but
she didn't.  She tried, but O'Malley had central
office men keepin' eyes on her, und she can't leaf
town."
</p>

<p>
Katie and Carrie were busying themselves in the
preparation of the supper, and the German seated
himself beside the invalid.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hoffmann," she said, "I've been tryin' to
think of lots of things while I've been sick, an' I'd
like to know how it is that women like Miss Rose
are allowed?"
</p>

<p>
He looked at her, hesitating, but her eyes were
frankly curious.
</p>

<p>
"Dot's von long story," he answered in his slow
tones, "un' dem as can tell it best is most all in
deir houses or in deir graves, or else, in de streets."
</p>

<p>
"Then I guess I was lucky to get away."
</p>

<p>
"If you don't mind me sayin' it&mdash;yes, miss."
</p>

<p>
"But don't the girls get free when the houses are
pinched?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Hermann, as gently as he could;
"dey don't get free.  Ofer to de Night Court a
voman has taken five s'ousand to a blace she has,
und how many sink you didn't go back to de vork
again?  Less'n von hundret und fifty."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see how they could," said Violet.
</p>

<p>
Hermann could not see how they could do anything
else, but he only shrugged his broad shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"They don't last long anyvays," he remarked.
</p>

<p>
"You mean they die soon?"
</p>

<p>
"Effery five year all de girls is new: it's as sure
as life insurance."
</p>

<p>
The girl shuddered, but mastered herself.
</p>

<p>
"Don't mind that," she reassured him.  "I want
to know&mdash;honest.  Katie and Carrie won't be bothered&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We can't hear a word you're sayin', darlin',"
laughed Katie.
</p>

<p>
"An', honest," Violet concluded.  "There's some
things I think I've got to learn so's I can see
it&mdash;see it <i>all</i>."
</p>

<p>
She appealed, it happened, to an authority.  Hermann
supplemented his Marx with facts and statistics
of a later date, especially upon the point at issue,
and he was only too glad to find in Violet the listener
that he could never discover in Katie.
</p>

<p>
"You're righd," he said; "und the only pity is
dot more people don't try to more about it learn.
If dey did, maybe ve'd all open our eyes some."
</p>

<p>
And he proceeded to open Violet's eyes not a
little.  He told her of the hundreds of thousands
of girls that are annually caught in the great net;
of how five thousand new ones are every year needed
to maintain Chicago's standing supply of twenty-five
thousand; of how Boston, Philadelphia, New Orleans,
San Francisco&mdash;all the cities and the towns&mdash;are
served proportionately, and of how, above all,
from the crowded East Side of New York, there are
dragged each week hundreds of children and young
women no one of whom, if sold outright, brings as
much as a capable horse.
</p>

<p>
"Some ve bring in," he said, "und some ve send
out.  Ve take from Italy, und ve send to Sous
America.  From all ofer the vorld ve take, und to all
ofer the vorld ve send."
</p>

<p>
"You don't always blame the girls?"
</p>

<p>
"Plame dem?  A girl as lived by us, she did
tucking in a undervear factory.  She has coffee und
a roll fur preakfast, tea und a roll fur lunch, von
biece of bacon und von egg fur supper effery nighd.
Ten hours a day in a bad smelling room, crowded
vis ozzer girls, she runs dot machine.  Part de year
she has no vork, because always de factory does
not run, but vhen de years ends, dot machine, makin'
four dousand stitches a minute, she has tucked dree
miles of undervear und got paid dree hundred
dollars.  Do I plame such a girl if she easy comes to
belief a paid veasel as makes lofe to her und says
he marries her und gets her avay from a factory?"
</p>

<p>
"All of the girls don't come from such hard jobs
though."
</p>

<p>
"So?  Look now!"
</p>

<p>
He took from an inside pocket a fistful of soiled
envelopes and shuffled them until he found one on
which he had transcribed some figures.
</p>

<p>
"Yesderday afternoon to dis Astor Library I
found a report vat vas made by people sent out
by de State of Massachusetts.  It got a kind of
census from four dousand vomen in sixty different
cities, all ofer.  Before dey vent bad, five hundret
vas garment-vorkers, und eight hundret vas rope-makers,
milliners, laundry people, paper-box, cigar
und cigarette makers, candy-box packers, or vorked
in textile mills or shoe factories.  All dem, see,
vorked in de poor paid trades, und a hundret und
sixteen come from department-stores, und dot's as
bad as Katie'll tell you.  Vorse yet de job of
house-servant&mdash;sixty per cent. vas dot.  Und all de
rest&mdash;all de ozzer sixty-two per cent.&mdash;vere girls who
hadn't had not jobs, und dey had to live und couldn't
no ozzer vay earn a livin'!"
</p>

<p>
"Then you think," asked Violet, "they wouldn't
go wrong if they could get decent work at decent
wages?"
</p>

<p>
Hermann looked at her quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Vould you?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
She shivered and shook her head and Hermann,
seeing that the heat of his zeal had led him into
a personal appeal that all his normally slow instincts
prompted him to avoid, hurried back to the safe
ground of generalities.
</p>

<p>
"Nobody vat knows," he said, "could belief it.
Nobody vat knows could belief girls'd go into such
a life, or once dey got into it stay dere, because dey
vanted to.  Vell, vat den?  Ve must find out vhy
is it dey gets in und vhy dey stay.  It is because
all de whole luckier vorld lets dem be kep' fast, und,
first und foremost, because all de whole luckier vorld
lets dose factories dey come from be bad blaces, und
couldn't gif dose ozzer sixty-two-per-cent girls no
ozzer vay to earn a livin' yet."
</p>

<p>
Violet thought again, as she still so often thought,
of Max.
</p>

<p>
"An' what about the men that start them?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
Hermann brought his heavy fist down upon his knee.
</p>

<p>
"Dem too!" he said.  "Dem is de vorst mens
in de vorld.  If I can hate any man, dey is him.
It makes my red blood to steam und my skin to get
all brickly to see dem or sink of dem.  But I know
dot dey, too, are results of conditions, und dey sink
dot dey are doing kindness to de girls by not letting
dem go to chail or starve.  De vorst mens in de
vorld&mdash;next to politicians as lets dem live und takes
most dot dey earn!  Und de politicians demselves
are only vat dot big system as makes us all vork for
less as ve earn, und makes us all pay more as ve
can&mdash;only vat de big system makes dem!"
</p>

<p>
Violet understood but partially; yet she had seen
enough to know that the slavery must have its political
side, and it was concerning this that she now
asked.
</p>

<p>
That Hermann made wholly clear.  He told her
the story of the growth of political parties, the
development of political machines, the necessary
preying of these machines, in every city, first upon
gambling and then, as that passed, upon prostitution,
and of how this meant both money and votes.
</p>

<p>
As he talked, she learned how this brought into
being the "cadets"&mdash;the followers of the low
heelers&mdash;who scoured their own and other towns, hanging
about the doors of factories, tenements, shops&mdash;wherever
the life was so hard as to drive those who
lived it to despair&mdash;themselves impelled by economic
conditions, by the choice between hard work and
small pay on the one hand and base work and better
pay on the other, and themselves forced into the
"gangs" of childish marauders while at the primary
schools, and so trained upward, step by step, to the
"gang" of the politician.  She learned how, after
the last outcry, a popular leader had struck a cadet,
in the presence of the press-agents, and then, when
this one blow was taken as the end of the infamous
relation, had quietly joined with his fellows in
strengthening that relation as it never could have
been strengthened with the attention of the public
upon it.  And she learned how the result had been a
whole criminal confederacy, with its capital in the
poorer quarters, bound together politically and
financially, with its officers, its agents, and its regularly
retained lawyers, at once to defend and to attack.
</p>

<p>
Out of his own observation, Hermann told her of
the saloons that were in reality the clubs of these
procurers.  He sketched the methods of procuring
false bail-bonds, of influencing magistrates, juries,
and even judges, and of turning upon the few
conscientious policemen with suits charging oppression
and false arrest.
</p>

<p>
"O'Malley und dese ozzer mens like him ofer
here make sometimes all of sixty dousand a year,"
he declared, "und de people lofe dem because dese
O'Malleys take deir daughters durin' twelve mont's
und gif dem coal fur four."
</p>

<p>
"An' no one person is to blame?" asked Violet
in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"I vish dere vas, but dere ain't."
</p>

<p>
"So there ain't no way out of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Von vay&mdash;und only von.  For de single time
badness makes poverty, ninety-nine times poverty it
makes badness.  Do avay vith poverty.  Reorganize
de whole of de industrial system; gif effery man und
voman a chance to vork; gif effery man und voman
effery penny dey earns.  So only you do avay vith
poverty, so only you do avay vith unhappy und
discontented homes und unhappy und discontented
people, und so only you do avay vith badness."
</p>

<p>
He was in the midst of his subject when Katie
served the scanty supper, and he would have had
neither time nor inclination for the mere eating had
not his sweetheart sternly ordered him to be silent.
But, as soon as the meal was over and the few dishes
washed, he continued his talk to Violet as, with the
two girls ahead of her, she leaned heavily on his
arm all the way to Rivington Street.
</p>

<p>
The concert was, it must be confessed, interesting
chiefly to the women that had promoted it, the young
people that took part in it, and the relatives of the
performers, who succeeded or failed vicariously.
Stiffly seated in the cleared gymnasium, a little
ashamed and wholly ill at ease, the audience, drawn
from the neighborhood and from among the friends
of the settlement-workers, bore it, however, with
commendable fortitude.  They heard an amateur
orchestra play "La Paloma" out of time; they heard Eva
Aaronsohn read an essay on "A Day in Central
Park"; they heard a promising soprano solo spoiled
by fright, and a promising baritone not yet escaped
from the loosening leash of boyhood.  Morris
Binderwitz delivered a hesitating oration upon Abraham
Lincoln, as culled from his former debate regarding
the great emancipator, and Luigi Malatesta, having
consulted the same original sources, repeated by rote
a ten-minute tribute to the military genius of George
Washington.  There was a duet, a piano solo&mdash;a
simplified version of "O Du Mein Holder
Abendstern."  Everything was conscientiously applauded,
nearly everything was encored and then, amid a
scraping of chairs and more strains from the amateur
orchestra, the ordeal came to an end.
</p>

<p>
As the crowd slowly dispersed, Carrie made her
way to the side of one of the women-workers with
whom she had some slight acquaintance and, after
the formal catechism upon "how she was doing,"
made her plea for Violet.  She told, of course,
nothing of the girl's story, nor was anything asked.  It
was enough that she should say that her friend was
fresh from the hospital, was in need of a position,
and, though still weak, was able to do light housework.
</p>

<p>
The woman to whom this appeal was made called
Marian Lennox to her side and, with a brief
explanation of what the girl had just said, introduced
Carrie.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you tell me," she asked, "that you'd
heard to-day of somebody that needed an extra servant?"
</p>

<p>
Marian had heard of such an opportunity.  The
word had not come at first hand, and the housewife
was personally unknown to her.  She was sure, however,
that the place was entirely estimable, and she
at once gladly gave the address, to which her
co-laborer added, upon strength of Carrie's assurances,
a recommendation.
</p>

<p>
Violet was brought over and presented, and when
Marian saw the girl's wan cheeks and dull eyes, and
read there the plain tokens of suffering, her own fine
face shone with sympathy.
</p>

<p>
She drew Violet aside.
</p>

<p>
"Have you ever done housework before?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Only at home, ma'am," said Violet.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you'll like it, I'm sure.  I can't see why
all you girls are so foolish as to go into factories.
Housework is so much more healthy and safe, and
it's just what women are made for.  It pays so well,
too.  Even if you can't cook, you can scrub and clean
and help and get three dollars or more a week for
it, and board, too."
</p>

<p>
"I think I'll like it," Violet assented, knowing in
her heart that she would like any work that gave her
a living and protection.
</p>

<p>
"Then be sure to come to see me after you're
settled," said Marian.
</p>

<p>
She was now wholly immersed in the work of the
settlement; but, though she had undertaken no
distracting outside investigation, her indoor duties had
thus far brought her into touch chiefly with children
of the neighborhood, and from them, wise beyond
their years as they were, she had learned only enough
to feel that she had not yet come into touch with the
great problems that her young heart was so eager
to answer.  In this first chance to give what she
conceived to be practical help, it seemed to her that she
was at last getting near to the heart of what she
sought.
</p>

<p>
How near she had come to the heart of another
problem, and how that problem was involved in the
problem of her own life, she little guessed as she
smiled into Violet's grateful face and, exacting
another promise that the girl should report to her in
any difficulty, bade her good-night.

<br><br>
IN SERVICE
</h3>

<p>
The house to which, next morning, Violet, still
weak and still afraid of her enemies, made,
with many timid inquiries, her slow way was
in West Ninth Street, near Sixth Avenue.  It was
a four-story, grimy, brick house, with rows of prying
windows through which no passer's eye could pierce,
a dilapidated little yard in front of it, and a
bell-handle that, when pulled, threatened to come off in
Violet's fist.
</p>

<p>
The woman that answered this uncertain summons
much resembled the building she inhabited.  She
was tall, and she had a sharp face just the color of
the house-walls.  The spectacles high on her beaked
nose gleamed like the windows and, like the windows,
conveyed the impression that they saw a great
deal without permitting any outsider to look behind
them.  Her once formidably austere black dress was
rusty, and her hands were so lean that Violet felt
sure they must stretch when one shook them.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" asked this woman in a
voice that cut like a meat-ax.
</p>

<p>
"Are you Mrs. Turner?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  What do you want?"
</p>

<p>
"I heard you needed a girl."
</p>

<p>
"Where'd you hear it?"
</p>

<p>
"At the college-settlement in Rivington Street."
</p>

<p>
The woman's mouth tightened.
</p>

<p>
"Don't see how anyone there come to know aught
o' me," she said.  "Got a reference?"
</p>

<p>
Violet, beginning to tremble lest this chance should
slip away from her, fumbled after the note that had
been written for her, and finally found it and handed
it over.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Turner's gleaming glasses read it twice,
plainly suspecting forgery.  Then she calmly placed
it in her skirt pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Where's your home?" she next demanded.
</p>

<p>
"In Pittsburgh."
</p>

<p>
"Hum.  How much do you expect?"
</p>

<p>
"Sixteen dollars," quavered Violet, who had
received instructions from Katie.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Turner shook her head vigorously.
</p>

<p>
"Won't do," she said.  "Can't pay it.  Twelve's
my best, and when I have a cook&mdash;I'm out of one
just now&mdash;all you have to do for it is to scrub and
sweep and clean the house, wash dishes, and wait on
table.  How long did you stay in your last place?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Turner gave another skeptical "Hum" as
Violet answered:
</p>

<p>
"Two years."
</p>

<p>
"Will you take it at twelve dollars, or will you
not?" asked the woman, sharply.
</p>

<p>
Violet had been told to descend gradually and not
to accept a cent under fourteen dollars a month;
but she was no haggler.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take it," she said.
</p>

<p>
"And good pay, too, considerin'," commented
Mrs. Turner.  "I dunno.  It someways don't look
reg'lar.  Got your trunk over to the settlement?"
</p>

<p>
Violet explained that she had no trunk; that she
had just come from the hospital and had as yet had
no opportunity to replenish what had been a sadly
depleted wardrobe.
</p>

<p>
"Hum!" said Mrs. Turner.
</p>

<p>
In the penetrating glare of the impenetrable
spectacles she studied the white face before her.
</p>

<p>
"You wait a minute," she concluded.  "Not inside.
Out here on the stoop."
</p>

<p>
She came outside herself and closed and locked
the door.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be back soon," she said, and Violet dumbly
watched her lank, hatless form stride to Sixth
Avenue and turn the corner.
</p>

<p>
True to her word, Mrs. Turner was not long gone.
</p>

<p>
"I guess it's all right," she announced, as she
reopened the door to the house.  "I 'phoned that
woman to the settlement.  She was out, but a friend
answered and said the reference is <i>genuwine</i>.  She
described you so's I'd be sure.  Looks queer of me,
p'r'aps, but a person can't be too careful in this
town."
</p>

<p>
The gleaming glasses seeming to search her soul
for a reply, Violet said that she supposed a great
deal of care was necessary.
</p>

<p>
"Try to get along without it," responded
Mrs. Turner, "and you'll mighty soon find out."
</p>

<p>
That ended preliminaries, and Violet, agreeing to
send for her few belongings, began work without
further formality.
</p>

<p>
She discovered that Mrs. Turner was a New Englander,
who conducted a boarding-house in a manner
that sensibly stirred the servants' sympathies in favor
of the patrons.  Just now the season had greatly
decreased these, but the absence of the cook&mdash;it was
a chronic absence&mdash;left plenty to be done.
</p>

<p>
Violet had to rise with the sun and attend to the
kitchen fire.  She had to help the mistress in the
preparation of every meal, and of the serving of
every meal and the washing of all dishes she was
left in solitary authority.  She made all the beds,
she emptied all the slops, she swept the floors, beat
the rugs, cleaned the windows, polished the stove,
and scrubbed the steps.  Even in the scant hours free
of actual work, she must still be within call of the
door-bell and Mrs. Turner's voice: the service was
continuous from dawn until ten o'clock at night.
</p>

<p>
It would have been, upon a frailer nature, a
terrible tax, but, fresh though she was from the
hospital, Violet, her sturdy stock standing her in
excellent stead, managed so to stagger through it that her
wracked nerves seemed actually to benefit by her
physical exhaustion.  Her lot had all the horrors
of the average disregarded under-servant and yet,
when she crept to her stifling attic room at night&mdash;a
room ventilated by only a dwarfed skylight&mdash;she
slept soundly and well.
</p>

<p>
The situation was one that could not, however,
long continue.  Mrs. Turner was a pious woman and
as such knew that there must be what she described
as "somethin' sneakin'" about any maid that could
bear her ill-temper.  Long experience of one servant
after another leaving the house in anger, had not
only innured the good lady to such losses, but had
ended by really creating a sort of appetite for the
kind of condolence that she secured from her
neighbors when without servile aid.  It was therefore with
almost a desire for the worst that she endeavored
to delve into Violet's past.
</p>

<p>
This course of innuendo, suggestion, and
cross-questioning, pursued by day and night, through work
and rest, in strength and weariness, ended one
afternoon when another boarder had departed, taking
three towels with him, as is the custom of departing
boarders, and when, as a matter of fact, Mrs. Turner
secretly felt that she could no longer afford
a maid.
</p>

<p>
"Where," she asked, meeting Violet on the stairs,
"is them towels as was in Mr. Urner's room?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Violet.
</p>

<p>
"Well, they was there this morning, before lunch&mdash;I
seen 'em myself&mdash;and now they hain't."
</p>

<p>
Violet recalled that Mr. Urner had been to his
room in the meantime and had then left forever.
</p>

<p>
"Hum," said Mrs. Turner; "but you see the
soap's gone too."
</p>

<p>
For some reason ungiven, the landlady plainly
thought that the theft of the soap&mdash;perhaps because
of Mr. Urner's personal habits&mdash;was proof positive
that Mr. Urner could not be the thief, and that
Violet must be.  The girl was not in love with her
work, but she was immensely comforted by the shelter
it gave her, and she now throbbed with terror
at the thought of its loss.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't take it, Mrs. Turner," she pleaded,
"honest, I didn't."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't just <i>say</i> you did," replied the landlady;
"but you can't blame me if I think things, the way
you come here.&mdash;Where'd you say your home was?"
</p>

<p>
The question was hurled so suddenly, and was
accompanied by such an uncommonly strong glare from
the penetrating spectacles, that Violet's slow brain
tottered.  For the life of her, she could not think
of the city that she had formerly mentioned.
</p>

<p>
"Well"&mdash;Mrs. Turner's foot beat sharply on the
floor&mdash;"that ain't a hard question, is it?  Where'd
you say you come from?"
</p>

<p>
In desperation, the girl named the first city that
her lips recalled.
</p>

<p>
"Philadelphia," she murmured, and realized at
once that this was wrong and that her tormentor
knew it.
</p>

<p>
"You said Pittsburgh last week, miss," clicked
Mrs. Turner.  She raised a knotty finger.  "Now
I ain't sayin' you took that soap nor yet them
towels&mdash;mind you that&mdash;but I am sayin' you lied.  Me and
liars ain't good company: you'd better go."
</p>

<p>
The tears came to Violet's eyes.  They overflowed
and she broke down.  In three short sentences she
had confessed enough for Mrs. Turner to guess the
entire truth, and had cast herself upon the woman's
mercy.
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Alberta Turner's straight bosom was no
pillow for the unfortunate.  Rugged as it was, it
was no rock of safety.  She drew her black figure
to its greatest height; she called upon all her
religious experience for backing, and upon all her
study of the Bible for phraseology, and she launched
at the girl a sermon the burden of which was that,
as she would have been glad to receive into her care
a woman that had erred and had repented, so she
was in Christian duty bound to cast forth and
utterly repudiate one that had shown herself far
from repentance by seeking employment without first
baring her inmost soul.
</p>

<p>
Violet, in a word, was put upon the street.  She
was told that she could have her few possessions
when she called for them, but she was given neither
the Rivington Street recommendation nor a new
one.
</p>

<p>
She had received no leisure to see her friends of
the tenement or the settlement during the days of
her service, and she could not bring herself to seek
them now that the black bird had again perched upon
her forlorn banner.  For half an hour she wandered
aimlessly through the quieter streets; for another
half-hour she endeavored to gather her courage.  It
was three o'clock in the afternoon before, desperate,
she had inquired of a policeman for the whereabouts
of an employment-agency, had found the grimy
place, passed through the gloomy room with lines
of toil-worn slatterns seated along its walls, and
stated, in hesitant accents, her mission to the fat
and frowzy woman in charge at a littered desk in
the room beyond.
</p>

<p>
That woman&mdash;she had a steady, calculating eye&mdash;looked
at her victim with a curious appraisement.
</p>

<p>
"What experience?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Very little," admitted Violet.
</p>

<p>
"Well are you&mdash;&mdash;"  The woman's voice dropped
to the tone of discretion.&mdash;"Are you particular?"
</p>

<p>
"Why no," said Violet sadly, "I ain't particular,
so as it's quiet."
</p>

<p>
The mistress smiled sagely.
</p>

<p>
"We can fix that all right," said she.
</p>

<p>
But she said it so knowingly that Violet found
herself hurriedly adding:
</p>

<p>
"An' so long as it's decent."
</p>

<p>
That it was well she had supplemented her preceding
speech, she at once perceived by the change
that came over the woman's face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said the woman in a tone at once
uninterested.  "Well, have you any reference?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  You see&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind why.  If we get you a job, some
of the girls have plenty, an' we can lend you one
of theirs.  Go out an' sit down an' we'll see what
happens."
</p>

<p>
Violet returned to the dark front room and took
a shrinking seat in a corner among the other
applicants: two lines of pasty-faced, ungainly, and not
over-cleanly women.
</p>

<p>
She picked up a tattered paper, dated the preceding
day, and tried to read it.  She saw that the primary
election had been held and that Wesley Dyker had
secured one of the nominations for magistrate; but
she was tired and disgusted and pursued the print
no farther, listening, instead, to the babble of gossip
that was going on about her.
</p>

<p>
Had she ever heard that New York was remarkable
for having a model employment-agency law, she
would there have learned how lightly that law is
enforced and how much the employment-agencies of
Manhattan resemble those of every other large city.
The foul beds in which these women slept three
at a time, and for the use of which the agencies
frequently charged a dollar and a half a night; the
exorbitant two and three dollars exacted as a fee
for every position secured; the encouragement given
servants to make frequent changes and increase their
fees; and the hard plight of maids dismissed from
service, whose only friends, being servants themselves,
had no shelter to offer&mdash;all these things were
the ordinary part and parcel of their talk.
</p>

<p>
The women chattered of their old employers and
bandied household secrets from loose lip to lip.
Family skeletons were hauled forth for merrymaking,
and testimony enough to crowd a divorce-court
was given against not a few respectable citizens.
</p>

<p>
All complained of ill-housing and loneliness.  Bad
enough at any time, the advance of the race of
flat-dwellers and the decrease of householders had
intensified all the evils that domestic servants have to
endure.  The best servants' rooms in the ordinary
houses were, it appeared, unheated; the worst were
windowless closets in a kitchen or alcoves in a cellar.
None of these workers had been given a room in
which they could fittingly receive their friends, and,
as many of them were forbidden to have callers in
the kitchen, they lived what social life was possible
on afternoons or evenings "off," on the streets, in
the parks, or aboard those floating bar-rooms that
are called excursion-boats.  Violet remembered
Fritzie; she remembered the heavy percentage of
servants that, according to Hermann, ended in
slavery&mdash;and she began to understand.
</p>

<p>
At five o'clock there entered the room a
pleasant-faced, stout woman, uncommonly homely, who was
obviously a prospective employer.  She looked about
her in embarrassment, and seemed uncertain where
to go.
</p>

<p>
Violet, beside whom the stranger was standing, rose.
</p>

<p>
"Are you lookin' for the office?" she asked.
"I'll show you the way."
</p>

<p>
The woman seemed to like her thoughtfulness and
seemed, after a quick glance, to like her appearance
even more.
</p>

<p>
"I am not particular about the office," said the
newcomer; "what I want is a servant.  Come outside
a minute and talk to me."
</p>

<p>
Violet followed her into the street, wondering.
</p>

<p>
As they reached the pavement, the woman smiled:
her smile was so pleasant that she almost ceased to
be homely.
</p>

<p>
"I am a practical person," she said, "and as I
also loathe and detest these agencies, I always, if
possible, engage a girl so that she won't have to
pay them their commissions.&mdash;Can you do general
housework?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"You don't look very strong."
</p>

<p>
The girl's heart throbbed.  Mrs. Turner had said
that dismissal was the result not of what had been
done but of the thing's concealment.
</p>

<p>
"That's only because I was ill awhile ago," began
Violet.  "I had been in trouble&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But you're quite well now?" the woman interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"Quite," answered Violet.
</p>

<p>
She did not know how now to proceed; but the
stranger, still smiling, soon gave her a chance.
</p>

<p>
"Any reference?"
</p>

<p>
"No, ma'am, I haven't no reference."
</p>

<p>
"How does that come?"
</p>

<p>
"I was fired from my last place."  She took a
breath, then a greater one, and concluded: "I was
fired because the woman I worked for found out
that I had been in trouble."
</p>

<p>
The stranger promptly ceased to smile.
</p>

<p>
"What sort of trouble?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
Violet saw that she had made a fatal error, but
she did not know how to end it except by proceeding.
</p>

<p>
"You know," she stammered, "there was a man&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The stranger raised a plump, gloved hand.
</p>

<p>
"Don't tell me that," she said.  "I have no right
to the details.  I think I understand your motive,
and it's creditable, I must say.  But, my dear, I
am by no means a beautiful woman and I have a
very susceptible husband&mdash;very.  I'm afraid I must
be going along."
</p>

<p>
And along she went, leaving Violet in a tossing
sea of emotion.  Mrs. Turner had lied, which meant
the girl must lie; this later employer had said that
the woman who had been enticed was generally
supposed anxious to entice others, a theory that also
meant that Violet must lie.  She returned to the
agency, convinced that her error had lain only in
a lack of skill at deception.
</p>

<p>
No other customers appeared during the rest of
the afternoon, and when the agency closed its doors
for the night Violet, too alarmed by the stories she
had heard to trust herself to one of its beds, sought
the nearest policeman&mdash;she was losing her fear of
policemen at last&mdash;and had him direct her to a cheap
but respectable hotel.  She had a little money and
she paid gladly for a room that was nearly comfortable;
but she could not sleep, and she returned to
the employment-office early in the morning with red
eyes and swollen cheeks.
</p>

<p>
Until long after noon she sat there, waiting.  She
watched everyone that entered; she looked at first
eagerly and at last appealingly at every possible
employer; but somehow the woman in the inner room
never sent for her.
</p>

<p>
At last Violet herself walked through the rear door.
</p>

<p>
The frowzy person with the calculating eyes looked
at her sharply.
</p>

<p>
"You back?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't left," said Violet.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I heard you tried to steal a customer
yesterday afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"That wasn't no customer; it was a friend of mine."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Well, what do you want now?"
</p>

<p>
"A job."
</p>

<p>
"I know that.  What else?"
</p>

<p>
"I want to give you this: I have six dollars, an'
I'll give you five down if you can get me a decent
job in a decent house this afternoon, an' then I'll give
you two dollars a week out of my first three weeks'
pay."
</p>

<p>
The frowzy person screwed her lips in a downward
curve that was probably intended for a smile.
</p>

<p>
"I've had that percentage game handed out to
me about a thousand times before," she remarked,
"an' I believe in such money when I get it.  Still,
I don't mind seein' that five."
</p>

<p>
Violet produced it, and saw it swiftly vanish down
a black cotton stocking.
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Tell you what I'll do.  Here's a
woman down on Washington Square wants a maid
to wait on table.  Can you do it?"
</p>

<p>
"I can try; but of course I've never done it
before."
</p>

<p>
"I'll rent you a couple of references in the name
of Bella Nimick&mdash;that'll cost you two dollars more,
an' I guess I'll have to trust you for it&mdash;an' the cook
down there&mdash;she deals with us&mdash;she'll give you some
pointers on the job.  You'll find it a good place.
They're old swells, an' the name's Chamberlin."
</p>

<p>
Violet lost no time in seeking this new address.
She found it to be a large brick house, with white
marble steps, facing the leafy square from the north,
and looking across the broad green lawn toward a
church that towered into the blue skies by day and
by night reached up toward Heaven with a fiery
cross.  The cook, to whom, through the areaway, she
made her application, proved to be an ample Swedish
woman, with a heart fashioned in true proportion to
her body, and a round, placid face that spoke well
for her mistress.
</p>

<p>
That mistress, Violet was without delay informed,
was an invalid, whose ills, if mostly fanciful, were
at least fancied with a force sufficient to keep her
in town and in the house all summer long.  Her
husband&mdash;she had remarried after a divorce&mdash;passed
the warm months visiting more wealthy friends along
the rocky Maine coast, and her son ran in to see her
between such invitations to Newport and Narragansett
as he could secure.  A daughter by the second
union, a girl of sixteen, remained to care for her
mother, and this child and a professional nurse,
whose long service made her almost a member of
the family, completed the household.
</p>

<p>
Violet was presented to Mrs. Chamberlin, a frail
woman with a white, delicate face, lying on a couch
in a darkened library, and, her references being
casually read, was promptly engaged.  She was to
receive eighteen dollars a month for far lighter work
than had been her portion under the sway of
Mrs. Turner, and, as Bella Nimick, began at once to see
that a better time was before her.
</p>

<p>
Objections there of course were, but these were
not of a sort that either Violet's previous experience
or present necessity permitted her to observe.
Brought up in wealth, Mrs. Chamberlin's ideals had
not been improved by that decline of fortune
consequent upon her marriage.  Neither in a practical
nor in an executive sense had she received any training,
and, though she would have told you that household
management was woman's true sphere, she
actually knew as little of it as she did of the
wholesale drug trade.  It had never occurred to her that
cooking was even distantly related to chemistry and
dietetics; scrubbing, dusting, and sweeping to
hygiene, or domestic administration to bookkeeping.
By the same token, the two servants had to share
a dark, narrow room in the basement, had no sitting-room
save the kitchen and, so far as social life went,
would have been, had they depended upon the
Chamberlin house, twin Selkirks on a Juan Fernandez.
</p>

<p>
But Violet was happy.  Her health, if it did not
improve, at least did not noticeably decline.  The
work, if it was hard, was at least possible of
accomplishment.  And within a week she had made
herself so valuable to both her mistress and her
mistress's nurse that these potentates found continuous
need of her.
</p>

<p>
Then the first blow fell.
</p>

<p>
She had just put away the last of the dishes from
an early dinner and was passing the barred front
window of the basement when, from the sunset
across the square, a shadow descended to the floor
within.  She looked up, startled.  In the areaway
a dapper, dark, flashily dressed young man was
standing, and the young man was Angel.
</p>

<p>
Violet darted away from the window, but Angel,
reaching through the bars, calmly raised the sash,
which, even in the warmest weather, was drawn
against the noise and dust of the street.  His dark
face was flushed, and though his wet, red lips were
smiling, they smiled evilly.
</p>

<p>
"No treecks," he commanded.  "You come to
me.  I wanta talk."
</p>

<p>
Violet did not answer.  She huddled into the
farthest corner.
</p>

<p>
"Stan' out!" continued Angel, his lips still
curved.  "You theenka me so dumb?  I am sharpa
'nough for see you.  You come here, or I go ope
stairs an' reenga da bell."
</p>

<p>
Slowly, like the bird advancing to the swaying
serpent, she obeyed him.
</p>

<p>
"Now," he said, when they were face to face,
"you alone?"
</p>

<p>
She thanked Heaven that they were.  The cook
was in the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
"Poot on you' hat an' come alonga with me."
</p>

<p>
"I won't!" said Violet.
</p>

<p>
"You do eet!"
</p>

<p>
"I can't.  The missus won't let me.  It ain't my
night off."
</p>

<p>
"Eef you don't, I go ope stairs an' tell all abouta
you."
</p>

<p>
"I don't care.  I won't go!"
</p>

<p>
"Queeck!"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Then da woman she fire you, an' I get you when
you come out alone."
</p>

<p>
Violet knew that he meant it.
</p>

<p>
"Where do you want to take me?" she asked.
"I won't let you never take me back to Rose's."
</p>

<p>
"No fear," laughed Angel, shaking his oily curls.
"Meess Rosie she would not stan' to have you near."
</p>

<p>
"Then what do you want?"
</p>

<p>
"I want you come to District Attorney's, da place
you go witha that fine gentleman Dyker.  You won'ta
be hurt.  You can peeck out any cop on da way to
go along, an' you weell knowa da place."
</p>

<p>
"Does he want me&mdash;that lawyer I talked to there
before?"
</p>

<p>
"I been to see him an' tell him we come."
</p>

<p>
"Then what am I to do when I get there?"
</p>

<p>
"Taka back all you say for thata Dyke'.  Da's
all: no more&mdash;only so mooch.  I won't bother you no
more; thata lawyer won't bother you no more; Dyker
won't bother you no more.  You do that, or losa da
job.  Wheech?"
</p>

<p>
Violet put her hand before her eyes.  She knew
as well as a wiser woman what had happened.
Angel had traced her to Katie's, to the hospital, to the
settlement, to the employment-agency&mdash;he was doubtless
familiar with such places&mdash;to this house.  Rose's
latest captive had been turned out on the streets
before the raid and lost to sight.  The entire
white-slavery charge now rested on Violet's testimony, and
Angel's purpose was to have her withdraw the affidavit
she had made.  In her present condition, she
could not, she thought, be of any further use to him;
that purpose served, he would be only too glad to
let her again hide herself, and, hidden here, with
Dyker elected and engaged by newer cares, she might
escape both friends and foes.  Terror drove out all
desire for revenge upon Rose Légère; it drove out
even the power to keep her promise to Dyker.  All
that she wanted was her job.
</p>

<p>
"All right," she said.  "Wait till I go upstairs
and get permission."
</p>

<p>
"No treecks," cautioned Angel.  "Eef you try
treecks, I go upstair' myself."
</p>

<p>
She promised, and left him, presenting to
Mrs. Chamberlin in the library, a moment later, a face
that bore out her story of the illness of a friend.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the invalid, "if you go out I shall
be certain to need you; but I suppose there is no
help for it.  Don't be gone more than an hour."
</p>

<p>
Violet joined Angel in the area, and went with him,
but, though she was disposed toward silence, she was
surprised to find the Italian in a pleasant, even a
genial, mood.
</p>

<p>
In his moment of success, he was well-nigh
magnanimous.  He bore not a trace of malice, seeming
to regard the whole matter as a game in which all
the moves on both sides had been in accord with
the rules.  He chattered a variety of gossip about
everything and every person save those who were
most intimately concerned in his present action, and
only as they neared the office, where a light showed
that the young assistant had remained in accordance
with the word that Angel had previously brought
him, did he touch upon the matter in hand.
</p>

<p>
"No treecks, now," he cautioned.  "All you gotta
do ees tella heem you were Rosie's frien' an' she
hit you, so you gotta drunk an' wanted to maka
trouble."
</p>

<p>
"Won't he be cross?" asked Violet, her agitation
returning anew.
</p>

<p>
"Naw," Angel reassured her.  "He's used to
sucha t'ings.  Don' forgot, an' I give you five doll'."
</p>

<p>
They entered the office that Violet just recalled
as having visited with Dyker in her fever-dream.
At a desk, covered with neatly arranged piles of
papers sat the young assistant, who, having then
seen her red with illness, and now seeing her still
white from its recovery, might well suppose that
their first meeting was the result of drunken malice.
</p>

<p>
"Here she ees," smiled Angel, "like I promise.
She ees a gooda girl now, an' sorry she tell you da
deeferent story an' maka trouble."
</p>

<p>
Angelelli had told Violet the truth: the young man
was indeed used to such things&mdash;so used to them that
he knew protest was fruitless and that his inquiry
must be formal.
</p>

<p>
"You want to withdraw your deposition?" he
asked.  He was a kindly young man with a thin
face.
</p>

<p>
"Do I what?" asked Violet.
</p>

<p>
"He means&mdash;&mdash;" began Angel.
</p>

<p>
"I mean," interrupted the lawyer, "do you want
to take back the story you told me about Rose
Légère?  This case is on the calendar for to-morrow,
so if you mean to take back what you said, you had
better do it now."
</p>

<p>
"It won't get me into no trouble?"
</p>

<p>
The young man raised his eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
"What would be the use?" he inquired.  "No,
it won't get you into any trouble."
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll take it back," said Violet.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to be sworn, you know."
</p>

<p>
"She don' minda that," said Angel.  "Do you,
Violet?"
</p>

<p>
The girl shook her head, and a clerk was called
and administered an oath so rapidly that Violet could
understand no word of it.
</p>

<p>
"You're doing this of your own free will&mdash;just
because you want to?" resumed the lawyer, donning
his professional air, and seeming to become infected
with the clerk's rapidity of utterance.  "You are
not swayed by any promise of pecuniary reward&mdash;that
is because you're paid for it?  And there has
been no force or threat used to compel you to do
it&mdash;I mean you haven't been told you'd be hurt if
you backed down?"
</p>

<p>
Violet bowed in token of a desire to answer these
questions in whatever way was necessary to her
bargain, and the new deposition proceeded in the same
manner and along the lines that Angel had laid
down.  The clerk hurried because he wanted to get
home; the lawyer hurried because he thoroughly
disbelieved every word that was written; and, severe
as Violet had feared that the ordeal would be, it
was over far sooner than she had expected.
</p>

<p>
Angel, still loyal to his word, saw her safely home.
</p>

<p>
"Now," he said, as he left her at the areaway,
"nobody weell ever any more bother you.  Good-night."
</p>

<p>
He raised his hat and went away, but, as he
turned, he pressed into her cold hand a crisp, new
bill.
</p>

<p>
Violet's fingers closed about it silently.  She had
earned it.
</p>

XIX
<br><br>
"FIAT JUSTITIA RUAT CAELUM"
</h3>

<p>
The trial of Rose Légère was precisely the
farce that Violet had expected and that
Angel had planned.  In ninety of such cases out
of every hundred, the chief witnesses for the state
are suppressed by fear or force, and the prosecution
collapses.  Thus, in the present instance, had not
the newspapers made first-page announcements of
the Légère woman's arrest and so attracted to the
case the momentary attention of an effervescing
moral public, the District Attorney's office would,
in fact, have contented itself with submitting the
indictment and asking for a verdict of not guilty.
</p>

<p>
With Violet in the hospital during the session of
the Grand Jury, Wesley, now a man of power, had
been able to refresh Larry Riley's memory to such
a point that, in the hands of the prosecutor, the
policeman's evidence was sufficient to insure the
finding of a true bill; but when the case was called for
trial the situation was vastly changed.  The girl that
had followed Violet into the net had been cast back
into the sea of the city and utterly swallowed up.
Violet herself had recanted.  The elder inmates of
the Légère establishment regarded the law as their
natural enemy and, had they been disposed to assist
it, could in no wise have been regarded as credible
witnesses.  The action had, therefore, to rest
entirely upon Riley's testimony, and for Riley's
testimony there was virtually no corroboration procurable.
</p>

<p>
"You're a good thing&mdash;I don't think," remarked
the weary-faced young Assistant District Attorney
as, on the morning of the trial, he met Dyker in
the corridor of the court.  "We shoved this case
about five years ahead on the calendar to please you,
and the night before it's called your witness comes
to my office and eats her deposition."
</p>

<p>
Wesley had already heard that piece of news.
When, in order to keep an eye upon Violet, he had,
some time previously, sought her at Katie's tenement,
and had received a series of uncredited vows
to the effect that the Irish girl had no idea of the
whereabouts of her late charge, he had begun to
look for a recantation.  It was the sort of game that
he had himself frequently played, and he blamed his
own lack of foresight in not better providing against
it.  Then other interests had arisen.  The campaign
came on apace; there were newer enemies than Rose
to be dealt with, and, when the wires leading from
the District Attorney's office had informed him that
the expected had occurred, he received the word with
calm philosophy.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he carelessly laughed in reply to the
young assistant's sally, "that's always the way: we
elect you people into your jobs and then you think
that we ought to get up your cases for you and hold
your witnesses."
</p>

<p>
He went on his way, unconcerned.  Scarcely less
concerned, the young assistant, knowing that his
cause was lost, proceeded into court with a solemn
air calculated to convince an outraged public morality
of his high intent; challenged juror after juror
with a frowning brow; outlined his case with biting
logic; examined Riley, as the officer on the beat,
together with the other policemen that had made the
arrest, in an heroic style eminently pleasing to the
reporters; finally worked himself into a profuse
perspiration of Ciceronian invective against the
prisoner and, mopping his weary face, sat down.
</p>

<p>
Equally without concern, and knowing his cause
was won, counsel for the defense, a suave little
personage, played his rôle as the cues came to him:
retained his suavity through an opening statement flatly
denying that of his learned young friend; pretended
to drop a little of the suavity through a series of
cutting cross-examinations that left nothing of the
policeman's vague testimony; and gave an excellent
imitation of throwing away all the rest of the suavity
when, in an impassioned speech, quite up to that of
his learned young friend, he declared that he would
call no witness (which he did not dare to do),
because the Commonwealth had wholly failed to make
out its case (which was quite true), and because a
respectable lady, the daughter of a mother, had been
outraged by ruffianly officers, her humble home
ruthlessly wrecked, and her livelihood endangered
(which was absolutely false).
</p>

<p>
So, at last, without any pretense at concern whatever,
the bottle-nosed personage on the bench ceased
drawing pigs on his blotter, and, sharing the
common knowledge of the fate of the case, gravely
instructed the unwashed jury that if they thought two
and two were four they should so find, whereas if,
on the other hand, they believed four to be the sum
of one and one plus one and one they were to
perform their sworn duty and so report.  And the
unwashed jury, without leaving the court-room,
declared Rose Légère an innocent woman.
</p>

<p>
The innocent woman, still the pleasantly stout lady
of the brewery advertisement, shook gratefully the
soft paw of her forensic defender.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God that's over," said she, with quite as
much feeling and quite as much reason as many
others of us return praise to Heaven for benefits that
originate a good deal nearer earth.
</p>

<p>
The suave defender smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, "thank God&mdash;and pay <i>me</i>."
</p>

<p>
"You'll get a check in the morning," Rose
replied, "an' I haven't a grudge against nobody,
though I do think that other lawyer might 'a' got
less gay with his tongue."
</p>

<p>
"He was only doing his duty, Mrs. Légère.  It's
the law, you know."
</p>

<p>
"What if it is?  I didn't make it.  What I don't
like to see is the way you people'll go back on your
friends because somethin' or other's the law."
</p>

<p>
She gathered her silk skirts free of contamination
by the low crowd in the court-room, and made her
way to a waiting taxicab outside.
</p>

<p>
"I think," she said, as that vehicle began to pump
through the streets, "I'll pay a little call on
Mr. Wesley Dyker."
</p>

<p>
She found him, somewhat surprised beneath his
drooping lids, at his office, and he immediately
agreed to see her alone.
</p>

<p>
"Now then," she said pleasantly, seating herself
unasked before his desk and leaning easily back in
her chair, "what I want to know is: Am I goin' to
be let alone?"
</p>

<p>
Dyker stroked his crisp mustache.  He wanted to
gain time.
</p>

<p>
"You were acquitted, then?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Looks like it, don't it?  See here, Wes, I know
where all my trouble come from, an' I can pretty
well guess how it come; but I'm willin' to ferget it
if you are.  Are you?"
</p>

<p>
Dyker's slow eyes were raised to hers, then lowered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said.
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Now you'll need me an' I'll lend
a hand, but I've got to know first off if I'm not goin'
to be interfered with."
</p>

<p>
"You had better see O'Malley about that."
</p>

<p>
"No, I hadn't.  You went to see him first; go to
him again."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;&mdash;"  Dyker twirled a pencil between his white
fingers.  "I shan't be sorry if I do?"
</p>

<p>
"You will not."
</p>

<p>
"I may count on that, may I?"
</p>

<p>
Rose squared herself in her chair.
</p>

<p>
"Got a talkin'-machine around here?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Why, no."
</p>

<p>
"Because I'd like to have some soft music while
I tell you the story of my life&mdash;see?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe you have to tell that."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do.  I want you to know just what I am;
then you'll see whether you can depend on me.  I
was brought up decent&mdash;that's the truth.  I had my
church an' Sunday-school like you had, an' perhaps
more.  The other sort of school I had to quit early,
because my old man wasn't paid enough to keep
me on, an' I had to go to work myself.  I was under
the age; but I swore I wasn't, so that was all right,
an' after I'd tramped over the whole town, I got
a job filin' letters an' addressin' circulars in a young
broker's office.  I was mighty little, but I was mighty
good lookin'.  I thought he took me for what I
could do, but I found out he took me for my looks."
</p>

<p>
She spoke quite without emotion, and Dyker, in
spite of himself, was interested.
</p>

<p>
"It cost that broker a lot to live," she continued;
"so much that he couldn't afford to get married.
When he'd got through with me, after a few years,
an' the baby was dead in the hospital, my people
were so damned respectable that I didn't dare go
home to them.  Wall Street had been plungin';
nobody'd buy stocks; I couldn't get a job there.  Times
was hard and I couldn't find a place anywhere else.
It was up to me to starve to death, go into a home
an' be marked for life, or get real money the best
way I could."
</p>

<p>
She paused, and Wesley found himself interjecting
an urging "Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I got the money.  My broker put me up
in a flat.  He stole the cash to do it, an' when the
fly-cops got next, he blew out his brains.  I was still
high and dry, so I got a couple of girls to help me.
Then I met Mike O'Malley's brother&mdash;the one that's
dead now&mdash;an' he squared things for me so's I could
open up the place you knew.  He owned my joint
an' was right an' regular.  He saw to it I wasn't
bothered, an' we paid for protection an' furnished
an address when his brother needed one for voters.
I never had no trouble 'till O'Malley's brother
was dead an' you queered me with Mike himself."
</p>

<p>
"And is that all?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's all.  It's about what you'd learn
from any other woman in my line of work.  But I'll
tell you one thing: I got my girls however I could&mdash;a
lot of 'em because your friends brought 'em, an'
everyone that was brought that way I paid for, fair
an' square an' good an' heavy; I had to keep the
women down because expenses was so high; but no
man was ever cheated in my place, an' no man was
ever robbed with my knowledge.  I may have bad
habits of my own, even for my sort of a life; but
I always treat my customers on the level, an'
I always see that my girls treat 'em on the level,
too."
</p>

<p>
"What about the hangers-on?" asked Wesley.
</p>

<p>
"You mean about Angel?  Well, I played double
because I didn't know who was goin' to be on top,
an' in this business you've always got to be on the
winnin' side.  Now you are on top an' there can't
be no question.  I'm in this line because I've got to
live; I couldn't do nothin' else; an' I'm goin' to
keep on in it as long as I live.  You see now that
I've always been on the level in one way; you see
that I haven't no reason now not to be on the level
in the other way.&mdash;Will you go an' fix it with
O'Malley?"
</p>

<p>
He did fix it.  He fixed it that afternoon, and he
fixed it so firmly that, within ten days, Rose, with
her former minions gathered from the corners where
she had hidden them, was living and prospering in
the house that Riley had raided.
</p>

<p>
Impartial Justice had been satisfied.

<br><br>
THE SANCTITY OF THE HOME
</h3>

<p>
Destiny, busy as she had been with the
affairs of Rose Légère, had not neglected the
usually serene residence of Mrs. Ferdinand
Wapping Chamberlin.  For ten hours the invalid
herself had been fretful.  This had reacted upon the
gentle nature of Mistress Madelaine, who had in
turn made the nurse to suffer, and the nurse, in her
own phrase, had "taken it out on" Lena Johnson,
the Swedish cook.
</p>

<p>
"An' it's all ban because that son of another
husband ban comin' home," said the naturally
good-tempered Lena, in an effort to pass along the general
discontent to Violet.
</p>

<p>
"What of that?" Violet asked.  "Is he home so
seldom that we've got to get the whole house ready
for him?"
</p>

<p>
It appeared from Lena's answer that the young
man was home far more frequently than his mother's
finances could well afford.  When he honored the
Chamberlin roof with his presence, he generally
managed to secure all the money within reach and to
devote that money to sociological researches that kept
him out until the lesser hours of the morning.  These
stubborn pursuits were, it seemed, highly disapproved
of by both his mother and his sister, yet both his
mother and his sister hated his father, the divorced
husband of the remarried Mrs. Chamberlin; and as
the son and brother constantly threatened that any
interference would result in a transfer of his
affectionate borrowings to the bank-account of his sire,
both women were, during his intermittent residence
with them, torn between their improbation of his
pursuits and their fear that he would desert the
maternal house for the paternal club.
</p>

<p>
"What's his name?" asked Violet, as she lent a
hand at the preparation of dinner.
</p>

<p>
"Philip," answered Lena, "an' it ought to be
Hungry Haakon."
</p>

<p>
And yet, when the prodigal reached the house that
evening and, admitting himself with his own latchkey,
hurried into the library where his mother and
sister, the former on the couch and the latter seated
beside it, were awaiting the announcement that dinner
was served, he would not have appeared, to any
stranger that could see him, a much worse young
man than most young men.
</p>

<p>
"Hello!" he cried, kissing both women lightly
on the cheek.  "Sister more of a lure for susceptible
hearts than ever!"
</p>

<p>
"Much chance <i>I</i> have!" murmured black-eyed
Madelaine, brushing aside a careful blonde curl
disordered by his onslaught.
</p>

<p>
"And the <i>Mutter</i> getting better every day,"
pursued the unabashed youth.
</p>

<p>
"Your mother," said Mrs. Chamberlin, her heavy
brows rising almost to the level of her lace cap, "will
never be herself again, and you well know it."
</p>

<p>
"Poof!  A lean horse for a long race, <i>Mutter</i>."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Chamberlin waved a thin hand in dismissal
of all discussion.
</p>

<p>
"If you mean to dress for dinner," she said,
"you had better begin, Philip."
</p>

<p>
"No use.  I have an engagement for to-night in
circles where evening clothes are rarely considered
quite proper, and I washed up at the club."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, then you stopped there before coming to
your home?"
</p>

<p>
"It was on my way."
</p>

<p>
"And you of course saw that terrible man?"
</p>

<p>
This being the term in which Mrs. Chamberlin
habitually referred to the husband that had been so
wicked as to permit her, after her elopement with
Chamberlin, to institute and win a suit for divorce,
her son merely nodded.
</p>

<p>
"But what's the use of bothering about that?"
he demanded.  "It was on the way, I tell you.
Cheer up: one may smile and smile and be a woman
still."
</p>

<p>
But his hearers, by way of response to this advice,
sighed audibly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think it was very considerate of you,
Philip," vouchsafed the younger.  "You must
remember that when you got that last check from
mother&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Madelaine!" cautioned Mrs. Chamberlin.
</p>

<p>
"I don't care, dear.  Philip, you must remember
that when you got that last check from mother, it
was on your distinct promise that you would not see
your father again for a year."
</p>

<p>
"And don't you remember," retorted Philip,
"that I afterwards, upon reflection, distinctly
withdrew that distinct promise as utterly and in essence
unfilial?  A woman can always remember more
things than a man has forgotten, and forget whatever
she doesn't want to remember.  If it had been
an honest woman instead of an honest man that
Diogenes was looking for, he'd have had to
throw away his lantern and hire a portable
lighthouse."
</p>

<p>
But he kissed the girl as he said this, and pressed
his mother's hand.
</p>

<p>
"The trouble with you two," he declared, "is
that you don't get about enough.  Seclusion makes
you serious."
</p>

<p>
"I wish," said Mrs. Chamberlin, "that you had
brought me back the news that you had grown more
like us."
</p>

<p>
"More serious?  Still harping on your son, dear!
No, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I've about given
up all hope of marrying money, and marrying anything
else is an impossibility.  I must be getting on
in years.  You know how it is: as we grow older we
become more particular and less desirable&mdash;when
we're old enough to have learned properly to play
the game of love, we're too old to play it."
</p>

<p>
"You're a mere boy," observed Madelaine, with a
toss of her blonde curls.
</p>

<p>
"And you talk like one," said Mrs. Chamberlin,
smiling in spite of herself.
</p>

<p>
"I'd never think of accepting anybody so young
as you are," the girl added.
</p>

<p>
Philip pulled her pink ear.
</p>

<p>
"That's right, Queen Mab," he agreed; "wait
till a man is large and round and settled.  And when
you do marry, marry for keeps: a little marriage
is a dangerous thing, eh, <i>Mutter</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Philip!"
</p>

<p>
What more she would have said to this criticism
of her own estate, Mrs. Chamberlin's son was not
just then to hear, for a Japanese gong interrupted
her with the melodious announcement of dinner, and
the son snatched his protesting mother in his arms
and, with Madelaine following, bore her into the
brightly lighted dining-room.
</p>

<p>
He looked at the shining silver and gleaming linen
and glass and china, and he saw the pale liquid that
filled one of the glasses at his own accustomed place.
</p>

<p>
"Good!" he cried.  "I hope Lena's hand has
not forgotten its cunning.  Stolen waters are sweet,
but the best cocktail is a dry one."
</p>

<p>
And then, with his living burden still in his strong
arms, he looked across the table and into the eyes
of the new servant.
</p>

<p>
The new servant, from the shadow, returned that
gaze.  She saw before her, in the person of her
employer's son, Philip Beekman, the black-haired,
gray-eyed young waster that had once promised her help
in the house of Rose Légère.  On her part, Violet
could have no doubt, and it was only with the utmost
exercise of self-control that she continued her duties.
But for Philip certainty was not immediately
obtainable.  He saw many girls in the surroundings in
which he had first seen Violet, and her he would
probably long since have forgotten had it not been
for the appeal that she had made to his surface
emotions.  Nevertheless, the walls of his own home did
not, in this case, form a setting that made for easy
identification, and, besides, though this woman had
recovered some degree of her health, the best of her
looks would never return.  Beauty is the quality most
remembered by such men as Philip Beekman, and
beauty lost is the best disguise against them.  Philip,
therefore, quietly deposited his mother in her chair,
and continued his easy raillery until the soup had
been served and the little family had been left, for
a time, alone.
</p>

<p>
"New maid?" he then casually inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mrs. Chamberlin, "and actually a
fairly competent one."
</p>

<p>
"What's her name?"
</p>

<p>
"Bella."
</p>

<p>
"Any more?"
</p>

<p>
"Really, I don't recall her family name, Philip.
What possible difference can it make?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," said Madelaine, "that he thinks her
pallor interesting."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, Madelaine!"
</p>

<p>
"Her last name is Nimick, Philip."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said Philip, inwardly reflecting that, in
the nature of things, a name could not much signify.
"I was merely attracted by the fact that she didn't
precisely resemble a servant.  Have you never noticed
how all men look as if they belonged to the class
below their own, and all women to the class above?
It seems as if a man could never rise above his
environment, and as if a woman could never descend
to hers."
</p>

<p>
He did not again refer to the subject, but the
subject was, during all the meal, keenly conscious that
his gray eyes were covertly watching her.  She moved
about the room with increasing difficulty.  Her hand
shook as she brought the salad-bowl, and she spilled
some of his coffee on the cloth.
</p>

<p>
As soon as Lena had left the kitchen and gone
upstairs, Beekman came into the pantry.  His
manner, neither that which she had once known nor
that which she had more lately observed, was quick
and threatening; his frank face was flushed with
anger.
</p>

<p>
"Your name is Violet," he said in a voice that,
though low, shook under the restraint that he put
upon it.
</p>

<p>
She was standing beneath a gas-jet, a little column
of dishes in her hand.  The cruel light showed the
havoc that had been wrought upon her, but it also
showed the marks that no years or change could
alter.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said, her own voice scarce a whisper.
</p>

<p>
"Did you&mdash;&mdash;" he bit his lip.  "Did you come
here to scare me?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
She put down the dishes.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Mr. Beekman?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I haven't any money, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Beekman!"
</p>

<p>
She put her hand before her face, and he saw
that he had been wrong.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," he sulkily said.  "In the
circumstances, it wasn't an unnatural supposition,
though my mother thoroughly understands my manner
of life; but I see now that I shouldn't have
said it."
</p>

<p>
He paused, and then, because he hated to be in
the wrong, he hunted about for another excuse for
attack, and, finding one, became more angry than
before.
</p>

<p>
"Only how dared you," he asked, "how did you
dare to come into this house?"
</p>

<p>
Violet bowed her russet head.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know it was yours," she said.
</p>

<p>
"You didn't know?"
</p>

<p>
"How could I?  Lena didn't happen to say nothin'
about you before to-day, an' your mother has a
different name."
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk of my mother!" he commanded.
</p>

<p>
Had Violet known all the truth of her mistress, it
would probably have flashed over even the servant's
dull brain that the difference between a woman
beaten into slavery and a woman that married
the man who, during her first marriage, had been
her lover, was a difference not of kind, but of
degree, and of a degree decidedly in the ethical
favor of the former.  However, she held her
tongue.
</p>

<p>
It was the best shield she could have chosen.
Through silence few fits of anger are strong enough
to reach, and the quick temper of Beekman began
slowly to spend itself.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see how you could come into any decent
house," he grumbled, "no matter whether you knew
whose it was or not."
</p>

<p>
Still Violet did not answer.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you didn't think about that, though,"
Philip pursued.
</p>

<p>
Violet was as yet too stunned at all adequately to
feel.  With a shaking finger she drew invisible
arabesques upon the shelf beside her.
</p>

<p>
"How did you get away from Rose's, anyhow?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
Slowly she raised her head.  Slowly she fixed him
with her tired blue eyes.  And slowly, still drawing
arabesques now unregarded, she answered:
</p>

<p>
"Does that make much difference, Mr. Beekman?"
</p>

<p>
"Wasn't I interested?" he blustered.
</p>

<p>
"Because, you see," she concluded, "however it
was, it wasn't by none of the help you promised."
</p>

<p>
The thrust just pierced his armor of convention.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well," he said, "what could I do?  I wanted
to help&mdash;you know that&mdash;but what could I do?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothin'!"  Her eyes clouded as if they looked
at something which, though clear to sight, passed
all explaining.  "Nothin', I suppose."
</p>

<p>
The words lent him courage.
</p>

<p>
"And I can't do anything now," he went on, his
anger cold, but his determination unchanged.  "I'm
sorry for you&mdash;on my word of honor, I am sorry for
you with my whole heart, Violet&mdash;but you can't stay
here&mdash;you must see that you can't stay in this house
another night."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were still on his.
</p>

<p>
"I know you think that," she replied, as if
puzzled and seeking a solution.  "An' I know what
you think goes.&mdash;But, myself, I can't see why
not."
</p>

<p>
"But, Violet, just consider!" he cried, his hands
outstretched.
</p>

<p>
"You wanted me to get away an' get a decent
job," she dully answered.
</p>

<p>
"Not here."
</p>

<p>
"What's the difference?  What's the difference
whether it's here or somewheres else?  I can't see."
</p>

<p>
"But here all the time I should know."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know, wherever you are, about lots
of others that don't get away?  An' does that hurt
you?  Wouldn't you know about me wherever you
are, about me wherever I went?  An' would that
hurt me?"
</p>

<p>
"You don't understand!"
</p>

<p>
He seemed to charge her with her admitted
incomprehension as if it were a crime.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't," she repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you see that if you were somewhere else,
it would be different?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, but I can't."
</p>

<p>
"Not if you were where nobody knew about you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't see that, Mr. Beekman.  I haven't
got any disease to give people."
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't thinking that."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you wouldn't tell on me to the people
I went to if I went somewheres else?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly I wouldn't."
</p>

<p>
"An' you don't think I'd steal, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not."
</p>

<p>
"Nor&mdash;nor get anybody who was kind to me into
the sort of a hell I worked so hard to get myself out
of?"
</p>

<p>
"How could I think it?  What are you driving
at, Violet?"
</p>

<p>
"This: that if all them things is the way you
say, I'm fit for any job I'm able to do&mdash;an' I'm able
to do this one."
</p>

<p>
"Not in this house."
</p>

<p>
"What's the difference where?"  Her voice was
still low, and her words still came slowly; but she
was, however imperfectly and painfully, beginning
to think&mdash;which is a very dangerous thing in any
exploited individual.  "What's the difference
where?" she asked.  "What you know don't make
me no worse, an' what I know don't make me no
better.  The truth's the truth.  What's happened's
happened.  I used to be a girl in Rose's house, no
matter if I was now workin' in your house an' you
do know what I used to be.  Wherever I am, I'm
what I am; your knowin' it don't help or hinder;
an' if I'm fit for next door I'm fit for here."
</p>

<p>
Philip Beekman passed his long fingers through
his black hair.  It was the gesture she had seen him
employ on that remembered night at Rose's, but now
it had a new significance.  The young man was as
much the creature of his surroundings as Violet was
the creation of hers.  He could no more appreciate
her point of view than she could comprehend his.
It was as if they spoke different tongues.  Beekman
was powerless to argue further, and when a man
reaches that condition, he takes a firm stand upon
authority.
</p>

<p>
"All right," he said; "we won't waste words.
The hard fact is that you've got to go.  I'm sorry,
but you've got to go and go now."
</p>

<p>
She bowed her head; she had finished.
</p>

<p>
He wished she would answer; he wished she would
fly into a rage; but as she remained dumb, he
continued:
</p>

<p>
"I suppose your hat and jacket are in the kitchen.
You can drop me a card telling me where to send
your trunk.  I'll explain this to your&mdash;to my mother
somehow.  I'll do whatever I can for you&mdash;outside."
</p>

<p>
A slow shake of her russet head was her reply.
</p>

<p>
"I'll give you a recommendation."
</p>

<p>
"I won't need none, Mr. Beekman."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I think I've got fifty dollars somewhere in
my clothes."
</p>

<p>
"I was paid my wages only this mornin'."
</p>

<p>
He looked at her in gray-eyed amazement.
</p>

<p>
"But I say," he began, "you aren't going to&mdash;you
don't mean you won't&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She did not answer.  She moved slowly and quietly
away.  She went to the kitchen, got her shabby
beaver hat and her long coat.
</p>

<p>
Philip, in the pantry, remained as she had left
him, erect, eyes and mouth wide.
</p>

<p>
A moment later he heard the area door open and close.

XXI
<br><br>
AN ANCIENT PROBLEM
</h3>

<p>
"An twent' from Rosie Légère's," said Angel,
"maka two hundre'."
</p>

<p>
Hermann Hoffmann, alone behind the
bar in Schleger's saloon, and half asleep as he bent
over a thumbed and stained copy of the last evening's
paper, scarcely raised his head.  It was half-past
one o'clock in the morning.  Except for
Angelelli and the man to whom he was talking at a
table by the door, the place was empty of customers,
and so unconcerned were these two late-comers that,
had he wished it, every word of their conversation
could have been taken down by the bar-keeper.
</p>

<p>
But the bar-keeper did not wish it.  He knew both
the men, and had heard something of the character
of each, as every good bar-keeper comes to know
and to hear about most of the regular patrons of
the establishment that employs him.  With Angel
he had even had a nodding acquaintance in the days
of the brewery-wagon, and since he had donned the
white jacket he had seen often the narrow-chested,
stoop-shouldered, slouching Austrian now in conference
with the dapper Rafael.  He had been told
that this Austrian, with his bristling brown hair,
pale face, and thin mouth, pulled downward at one
corner by an ugly scar, made his regular living by
appropriating the wages of a girl that he nightly
drove forth to scour the dark streets, earning what
money she could from what looks were left her and
stealing what she could not earn.  And Hermann
knew that, now an election was near, both of these
proud possessors of the suffrage were doing their
exacted duty for the powers that permitted them to
thrive, and were, like the army of others in their own
profession, through all New York, Chicago, Boston,
Philadelphia, through the tenderloin of every American
city, providing for the voting of repeaters, of
dead men, of men that never were, in the interests
of whichever of the two great political parties
happens to be in control of the city where such votes are
needed.
</p>

<p>
"Mirka," said Angel, laying down his gold-rimmed
fountain-pen and looking up from the back
of the envelope on which he had been making his
calculations, "we weell need a hundre' more."
</p>

<p>
Mirka, the Austrian, tried to smile, but that ugly
scar at the corner of his mouth caught the smile in
the making and pulled it down into a sinister
sneer.
</p>

<p>
"I can smoke out fifty if you can," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Da sama kind?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
Hermann, behind the bar, frankly yawned.  He
remembered, with a slow smile, how, when he had
first come across such practices, years ago, he had
gone to the ward-leader of that party in whose
interests the work was being done.  He remembered
how this potentate had first assured him that he had
"heard wrong," and finally met his persistence with
a warning that he had better keep his mouth shut.
He remembered how, at the rival headquarters, he
had been told that there was always a mass of such
evidence, none of which could be effectively used
before election, and how, when he had ventured to
suggest that an election-offense was punishable after
election-day, he had been ridiculed.  And lastly, he
knew that his own Socialist friends had already all
the information that he had now obtained, but could
do no more at the polls than lodge protests that
would be overruled by the election-judges and
subsequently pigeon-holed by the courts.
</p>

<p>
"All right," Angel was saying, as he pocketed his
pen and tore the envelope into small bits, which he
tossed deftly across the room into the gutter beneath
the bar.  "I feexa heem.  I geta da rest."
</p>

<p>
The two men rose and stepped to the bar for a
nightcap of whiskey.
</p>

<p>
Already the Austrian had drunk more than was
good for his temper, but Hermann, whose eye was
usually exact in discerning such matters, was sleepy
to-night, and did not notice this.  Angel poured a
bountiful portion from the cool metal-stoppered
bottle that Hoffmann shoved clanking toward him.
Mirka decanted even more, and then momentarily
released his hold of the bottle to speak to his
companion.  Hermann, thinking both men satisfied,
reached for the liquor.
</p>

<p>
"Keep your dirty fingers off of that!" cried
Mirka, with no trace of his nationality in his speech.
"Can't you wait till I pour a real man's drink?"
</p>

<p>
Hermann flushed.
</p>

<p>
"It's a bath, den, you're goin' to dake?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I will if I like, you damned fool!" rejoined
Mirka, his eyes warming.
</p>

<p>
Hermann's blue glance surveyed the uncouth,
slouching figure.
</p>

<p>
"All righd," he said; "you need von."
</p>

<p>
The Austrian glowered.  Then, tilting back his
bristling head, he tossed the liquor down his long
throat.
</p>

<p>
"Give me another, you Dutchie," he ordered,
pushing his glass across the bar.
</p>

<p>
Angel began a quieting word, but Mirka broke
in, still addressing Hermann.
</p>

<p>
"Get a move on, or I'll break yer face, Dutchie!"
he insisted.
</p>

<p>
Hermann's jaw was suddenly set in a rigid line.
He remained motionless.
</p>

<p>
"Come on, now!" said Mirka.
</p>

<p>
"Don' maka these treecks," protested Angelelli,
dividing his plea between his hearers, and placing
his hand upon the Austrian's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"You shut up!" retorted Mirka, shaking himself
free.  "And you, you Dutch fool, give me a
drink&mdash;quick!"
</p>

<p>
Hermann did not obey.  He saw at last the
fellow's condition.
</p>

<p>
"You've had enough," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Mind yer own business," snapped the Austrian.
</p>

<p>
"Dot's what I'm doing," answered Hermann,
calmly reaching for the empty glasses.  "You're
drunk."
</p>

<p>
He had hardly spoken before Mirka, his habitual
lassitude dropping from him like a discarded cloak,
made a quick leap that brought him half across the
bar.  The glasses crashed, the bottle was overturned,
and in the Austrian's waving, clenched right hand
there flashed a knife.
</p>

<p>
It was a moment of action, but a moment only.
From one side of the bar, Angel had gripped Mirka
by the waist and was pulling him backward; on
the other, the powerful German had caught the
threatening fist and now, with a quick twist, sent
the knife plunging into the tub below the beer-spigots.
</p>

<p>
Spluttering obscenities, the Austrian was dragged
to the position from which he had made his attack.
</p>

<p>
"You keepa quiet!" commanded Angel of the
one combatant, and to the other: "You getta more
fresh with your mouth an' I getta you fired."
</p>

<p>
Hermann had recovered the knife and was now
calmly drying it upon a bar-towel.  Such incidents
were not unusual in his occupation and, now that
this one was closed, he could afford to smile his
answer to Rafael.
</p>

<p>
Mirka, on the other hand, though still tightly
embraced by Angel, was trembling with rage.
</p>

<p>
"I'll get you for this, Dutchie!" he declared.
</p>

<p>
"So?" said Hermann.  He still smiled, but he
was tired of being called Dutchie, and his tongue
ran just a hair's breadth ahead of his caution.  "Try
it," he concluded; "try it, you dirty Austrian loafer,
und I'll somevheres go vhere dose names you've been
makin' oud vill get you vhat you deserve."
</p>

<p>
"Whata you say?" Angel kept his hold upon
his friend, but the reference to their recent
occupation brought a glint of anger into his own eyes.
</p>

<p>
By way of beginning his reply, Hermann smilingly
returned the knife to its owner, who seized it with
a growl of malice.
</p>

<p>
"Neffer mind vhat I say den," he answered.
"Vhat I say now is 'Goot-nighd.'  You two get
oud."
</p>

<p>
He raised his thick arm to point to the door, but
in the manner of its raising there was another
significance.  For a moment Angel and Mirka met
hotly his steady gaze.  Then the bar-keeper raised
carelessly his other hand: it held a stout bung-starter.
</p>

<p>
The two men, with a common impulse, turned and
silently left the place.
</p>

<p>
Hermann was not afraid of them.  He knew that
his threat of betrayal had been idle, for the excellent
reason that there was no quarter in which betrayal
would be effective, and he told himself that, as soon
as their anger and their drunkenness had in some
measure subsided, the plotters would recognize this.
So he whistled complacently as he polished the bright
surface of the bar and did not hesitate, when he
began at last to wash and put away the glasses, to
turn his back to the swinging door of the saloon.
The campaign was not one that was considered
important and, personally, he cared but little about it
or what enmities it might awaken.
</p>

<p>
The campaigners cared, however, a great deal.
There was in no sane mind any question of the
result, but so mighty is custom that there were few
sane minds that did not publicly pretend to be in
doubt upon the issue.
</p>

<p>
For many days previously, any outsider, reading
the newspapers or attending the mass-meetings in
Cooper Union and Carnegie Hall, would have
supposed that a prodigious battle was waging and that
the result would be, until the last shot, in doubt.
There were terrible scareheads, brutal cartoons, and
extra editions.  As the real problem was whether
one organization of needy men should remain in
control, or whether another should replace it, there
were few matters of policy to be discussed; and so
the speechmaking and the printing resolved themselves
into personal investigations, and attacks upon
character.  Private defectives were hired, records
searched, neighbors questioned, old enemies sought
out, and family feuds revived.  Desks were broken
open, letters bought, anonymous communications
mailed, boyhood indiscretions unearthed, and women
and men hired to wheedle, to commit perjury, to
entrap.  Whatever was discovered, forged, stolen,
manufactured&mdash;whatever truth or falsehood could be
seized by whatever means&mdash;was blazoned in the
papers, shrieked by the newsboys, bawled from the
cart-tails at the corners under the campaign banners,
in the light of the torches and before the cheering
crowds.  It would all be over in a very short while;
in a very short while there would pass one another,
with pleasant smiles, in court, at church, and along
Broadway, the distinguished gentlemen that were
now, before big audiences, calling one another adulterers
and thieves; but it is customary for distinguished
gentlemen so to call one another during a manly
campaign in this successful democracy of ours, and it
seems to be an engrossing occupation while the
chance endures.
</p>

<p>
Though he often trembled, Wesley Dyker, perhaps
because his records of any sort were as yet but
brief, escaped with a fairly clean skin this Yahoo
discharge, but the downpour continued all about him
with tremendous vigor and at tremendous cost.  The
Republican leaders, fully expecting defeat, assessed
their supporters just as heavily as if they were
certain to triumph, spent much time and more money
and no end of breath.  The Reformers, under varying
factional names, bewildered, sometimes advisedly,
the independent voter by here joining one leading
party, there endorsing another, and in a third
place clamoring for a ballot so split and so
subdivided that the average man could in no wise
comprehend it when marked.  The Socialists, to be sure,
went along calmly enough, confessing their numerical
weakness and securely seeing in the small increase
of the present day the promise of the large majority
of the distant morrow.  But all the while the
Democratic organization thundered an inch forward in the
light and ran a mile forward in the darkness by
precisely the same powers as were invoked, with so much
smaller results, by the Republicans and the Reformers.
</p>

<p>
Not that there was any reason to doubt the
organization's victory.  There was none.  But every
organization always insists that, no matter how easy
the skirmish, its leaders must so manage that it comes
out of the fray to all appearances stronger than it
came out of the fray preceding.  Each majority must
be larger than the last, and so the lists are padded,
and the repeaters imported, and the lodging-houses
colonized, and the organization, like the frog in
La Fontaine's fable, though with less reason, swells
and swells against the hour when it shall finally burst.
The saloons were crowded; it was freely predicted
that, the season being prosperous, votes would go
at no lower than two dollars, and, in some quarters
and some instances, as high as five dollars
apiece.
</p>

<p>
There were some points, however, to which the
tide of prosperity had not risen, and one of these
was the high tenement of Katie Flanagan.  The
Irish girl returned there every night a little more
discouraged than when she had left its precarious
shelter in the morning, as doubtful as ever of
Hermann's ability to support a wife, but more doubtful
than ever of her own ability to help, should they
marry, in the support of the home.  At the shop,
the work and the hours weighed more and more
heavily upon her; they dragged at the heels of her
mind when she endeavored to evade the insulting
compliments of the callow youths and gray men that
strolled by her counter, and they were impedimenta
that made it daily more difficult to escape without
offense the oily approaches of the dignified Mr. Porter.
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes," she said one evening, as she and
Carrie sat over their meager supper, "I begin
wonderin' again whether it's worth while runnin' away."
</p>

<p>
The striking shirtwaist-maker, who had spent a
long day on picket-duty before a Waverley Place
factory, looked up with round eyes calmly serious.
</p>

<p>
"That is what I am wondering all the time," she
replied.
</p>

<p>
Katie made an impatient movement of her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Och, now," she generously protested, "it's all
right for me to growl, because I've got a job.  I
don't count, an' it's just me habit.  But you mustn't
do it, me dear."
</p>

<p>
"I am not complaining; I am just honestly wondering,
that's all."
</p>

<p>
"But if the worst came, you could go back to
work, you know."
</p>

<p>
Carrie's face was all surprise.
</p>

<p>
"And turn traitor to my friends striking in my own
and all the other factories?" she asked.  "Oh, no;
you would be the last to do it yourself, Katie.  I
would rather go on the street."
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean that, darlin'."
</p>

<p>
"I do mean it.  If I went on the street, I would
hurt myself, but if I did the other thing I would
hurt all the other girls in the union."
</p>

<p>
She spoke quietly, but with infinite conviction, and
Katie knew the forces that had brought about this
state of mind.  The widespread strike, though it still
continued, was a failure.  Public sentiment had never
been aroused; the employers had succeeded in securing
non-union labor, whose wages they were, even now,
securely reducing, and whose privileges&mdash;granted to
entice them to work&mdash;they were curbing; their
political powers earned them the armed assistance of the
law; and the strikers' ranks, though but little thinned
by desertion, were steadily decreased by poverty, by
the necessity of the girls to find other sorts of work,
by illness, and, now that the cold autumn had set
in, by death.  Carrie was underfed, scantily clothed,
penniless, and Katie, remembering these things,
found herself without reply.
</p>

<p>
Had she needed further example of the pressure
of conditions upon her kind, she could have found
it in an incident in the shop on the day following.  A
bull-necked young man, with ruddy cheeks and a
certainty of manner that spoke as loudly in his eyes
and his scarf-pin as in his voice, sauntered up to
the silk-stocking counter, where she happened then
to be stationed, and began turning over the wares
displayed.
</p>

<p>
"Have you been waited on?" inquired Katie.
</p>

<p>
"No," said the young man, looking at her steadily;
"but I'd like you to wait on me.  Are you
busy?"
</p>

<p>
Katie said nothing, but stood there.  The young
man said nothing.  Katie began to finger the boxes
before her, but she felt that the young man was
looking only at her.
</p>

<p>
"What quality would you like me to show you?"
she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Well," parried the customer, "what quality do
you like?"
</p>

<p>
She shot one glance at him: he was still looking
at her.
</p>

<p>
"We have only the best at this counter," she
answered, with a slight flush.  "You'll be findin' the
cheaper the sixth aisle to your right."
</p>

<p>
But the young man only laughed with unconcern,
and continued to keep his gaze on her lowered Irish
blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I can afford the best of everything," he said.
</p>

<p>
There was a pause.  Katie raised her eyes and
met his own without flinching.  He smiled, but he
was quite too satisfied with his own charms to notice
that the salesgirl was not smiling.
</p>

<p>
"What time do you quit work?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I never quit."
</p>

<p>
She said this as if she were closing a door, but
the young man proceeded imperturbably to rattle at
the knob.
</p>

<p>
"I thought," he said, "that you might like to
eat a little dinner over at the 'York' with me this
evening."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," the girl answered, "but I do all me
eatin' with me husband.&mdash;Will you, please, be tellin'
me what sort of stockin's you want?"
</p>

<p>
The young man grinned.  He seemed to enjoy
what he took to be her playful repartee.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," he replied, "my wife is away back
home, and I'm all alone over at that hotel."
</p>

<p>
He was leaning airily toward her, both hands on
the counter.  Katie, standing opposite, leaned toward
him.  She answered his smile, but he could not see
that her smile was not of his own sort.
</p>

<p>
"Do you want to buy anything?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the customer, meeting her gaze again.
"Will you sell?"
</p>

<p>
It was no unusual incident, no more unusual than
the coming incident of Mirka's attack upon
Hermann, but the girl had reached the end of her
endurance, and what followed across that counter was
not unlike what was to occur across Ludwig Schleger's
bar.  Katie opened her firm, pink palm and
smacked the young bargain-seeker smartly across the
mouth.
</p>

<p>
There was no immediate consequence.  The aisle
was too crowded to allow any but the nearest
employees to witness the blow, and the crowd was too
intent upon its own thousand errands to heed what
happened before its eyes.  One or two salesgirls
stood still at their work, petrified by alarm.  One
or two customers hesitated and chuckled.  And then,
as the young man with a face of crimson shouldered
his way into a hurried oblivion from which he never
reappeared, the rush of business sent the clerks
whirling about their own tasks and sent the crowd
hurrying about its own purposes.
</p>

<p>
But Katie knew that more would follow, and that
what would follow would be an interview with
Mr. Porter.  The shop's system of surveillance missed
nothing, and within a half-hour the girl was standing
in the dark office where she had first been hired.
</p>

<p>
In his likeness to a Sunday-school superintendent
Mr. Porter was shocked and grieved to hear that
any young lady in the Lennox store would strike a
purchaser.  In his likeness to a surgeon he promptly
declared that there ought to be no issue short of
expulsion.  And in his own hidden character&mdash;deep
in his own abominable character&mdash;he was wondering
whether he could not turn this incident to the
advantage that he had so long sought.
</p>

<p>
"The viper was insultin' me," said Katie.
</p>

<p>
"Are you quite sure of that, Miss Flanagan?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure I'm sure.  Do you have to wait for a snake
to bite you before you know what he's up to?"
</p>

<p>
"You could have called the floor-walker."
</p>

<p>
"And been fined for me pains, Mr. Porter."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Porter tapped his desk and kept his eyes on
his fingers.
</p>

<p>
"I find," he said slowly, "that most men do not
make approaches without some encouragement, in
either word or manner, on the part of the girl.  I
also find that such occurrences as this are very rare
in the experience of most of the girls in our employ."
</p>

<p>
He stopped, but Katie stood silent by the arm
of the desk, her lips compressed, a frown between
her arched black brows.  He sent a crooked glance
up at her, and then resumed:
</p>

<p>
"I scarcely ever have a case of this sort to deal
with.  I wonder why, if such things are done by
customers, the other girls do not report them."
</p>

<p>
He stopped again, and this time Katie answered:
</p>

<p>
"I suppose they boss their own lives in their own
way, Mr. Porter."
</p>

<p>
A faint spark of color shone in Mr. Porter's white
cheek.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose they do," he answered, gently pulling
at his side-whiskers, and peeping at his victim over
the caressing hand.  "In fact, between you and me,
Miss Flanagan, I am told that some of them do
that so well that they are practically independent of
their wages in this store."
</p>

<p>
Again Katie failed to respond.
</p>

<p>
"Do you understand me, Miss Flanagan?"
</p>

<p>
Katie thought of her desperate days before she had
found her present employment.  She thought of
Hermann and what seemed to be the sole chance of
rising to a salary where marriage could be a practical
possibility.  She thought of Carrie's plight and
of Carrie's dependence upon her.
</p>

<p>
"I do that, Mr. Porter," she answered.
</p>

<p>
He looked up squarely then, and she even
managed to torture her face into an expression of
roguery.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said Mr. Porter, smiling a paternal smile.
He reached out and patted her hand, and, though
her soul revolted, she managed to keep her hand
passive.  "Now, my dear young lady, you are at last
coming to your senses.  You mustn't take life so
seriously."
</p>

<p>
"I'll try not to, Mr. Porter."
</p>

<p>
"That's right; that's right.  I ought to discharge
you, I know.  It may be difficult not to discharge you.
But I will do this much: I will suspend judgment for
a few days."
</p>

<p>
He looked at her fixedly.  Her cold lips formed
another phrase of thanks.
</p>

<p>
"And in the meantime," he continued, "you let
me know of some evening when you can come out
to a quiet corner where we can have supper together,
and where we won't be wasting the firm's time.  Then
we'll talk this whole thing over, and I'll see what
I can do."
</p>

<p>
The eyes of neither wavered.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Mr. Porter," said Katie again.
</p>

<p>
With that she left him, but she went away with
the knowledge that her game of hide-and-seek was
almost ended.  Just when it would end was beyond
all guessing, but that it would end soon and that
it would end in her defiance of her superiors and
her prompt expulsion seemed altogether certain.  She
reflected that the small delay which she had gained
would profit but lightly those in whose interests she
had attempted to truckle and palliate, and, when,
that night, she told her experience to Carrie, her
words fell upon ears that read into them a
portentous meaning.
</p>

<p>
The homely, brown-haired Lithuanian, whose
cheeks were less round now than they had been,
and whose hair that needed no covering in the
summer, was still uncovered, went to her weary
picket-duty in Waverley Place the next morning&mdash;the
morning, as it happened, that preceded Hermann's
little brush with Mirka&mdash;with a slow step
and a heavy heart.  She knew the futility of the
work she was performing; she saw it even in the
relaxed vigilance of the policemen on the corners
and in the mocking grins of the girls and toughs
at the gloomy factory-door.  All day as, sometimes
companioned and sometimes alone, she plodded her
eventless round, the irony of the task bit into her
soul.  Something she must do, and soon.  Already
she was deep in Katie's debt, and Katie was near
dismissal.
</p>

<p>
The early autumn twilight dropped among the
grimy buildings.  The evening tide of Broadway
rose and roared into Waverley Place.  A cold wind
lashed the dust into little whirlpools, wound the girl's
cheap lawn skirt tightly about her aching knees, and
ate through that thin material to the tingling skin.
There was no one with her now, and she felt more
than ever alone.
</p>

<p>
From the shadow of a doorway a man crossed
the street and approached her.
</p>

<p>
He was a man of uncertain age, of almost any age
below the early thirties.  As he bowed to her, the
girl saw that his hair was dark and curly; that the
back of his hand, which was not the hand of a
worker, was covered with a black down, and that
through the pale olive of his sorely clean-shaven
cheeks there shone the blue-black banners of a wiry
beard fighting for freedom.  His lips were thick
until they smiled, above white teeth, in greeting, and
his gray glance had the character of an appraisement
of whatever it looked upon.  Carrie noticed,
protruding from his breast-coatpocket, a purple
bordered handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
"Hello," he said.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him gravely.  She had never seen
him before, but with his kind she had lately grown
enough familiar.  Wherever there are women on
strike, men of his sort gather, as the vultures gather
about dying animals in a jungle.  Yet Carrie said
nothing.  She was, as she had expressed it to Katie,
still wondering.
</p>

<p>
"I've been <i>vatch</i>in' you," said the man.  "I've
been vatchin' you all <i>tay</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Have you?"  Carrie was totally incurious.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'd think you'd be pretty tired of sooch
<i>fool</i>ishness."
</p>

<p>
"I am tired."
</p>

<p>
"You can't vin.  If you go back it will be <i>choost</i>
the same hell-mill it vas be<i>fore</i>."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it would."
</p>

<p>
"Vell then"&mdash;his hands spread themselves in
protest&mdash;"vhy don't you <i>qvit</i>?  A pretty, strong girl
like you could make <i>loads</i> of money fer herself."
</p>

<p>
Carrie was leaning against the factory wall.  She
did not move.
</p>

<p>
"How?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Vell, you hafn't got no <i>od</i>der trade, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Und you vouldn't vant to be a <i>ser</i>vant?"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"Because that's vorse nor a <i>shirt</i>vaist-factory."
</p>

<p>
"Then I wouldn't want to be a servant."
</p>

<p>
Again the man extended his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Vell?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"But I knew one girl that went into a house,"
affirmed Carrie, "and I wouldn't do that for a
fortune."
</p>

<p>
Her practical manner might have disconcerted
most men, but this man's business had accustomed
him to all forms of rejoinder.  He immediately
began an endeavor to persuade her by economic
arguments.
</p>

<p>
But Carrie interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said, "if I do it, it will be only because
I have to, and then I'll not do it that way.  Thank
you, just the same.  Here comes my relief: I don't
have to wait till the girls come out to-day.  Good-by."
</p>

<p>
He essayed to protest, but she walked quietly by
him, made her brief report to the oncoming women,
and started on her journey homeward.  The man,
whose trade imposed patience, said no more.  He did
not again approach her, and, though she knew that
he was following her, through the growing crowd
that rolled eastward, to mark her hiding-place, she
did not attempt to elude him.  She was very tired.
</p>

<p>
This was the evening that preceded the early
morning call of Angel the Italian and Mirka the
Austrian to Ludwig Schleger's saloon, and it was
about eight hours later that Hermann, having seen
his assailants leave, turned his back to the bar-room
door and, alone in the place, set about washing the
discarded glasses.  Except that he was sleepy, he
was in his usual spirits and he was whistling "Die
Wacht Am Rhein."  He was whistling so loudly
that he did not hear the door reopen.
</p>

<p>
There was a flash as of a thousand blinding lights,
a roar as if a train had fallen from the elevated road
overhead, and Hermann, in the smoke-filled saloon,
himself fell crashing behind the bar, and lay there,
huddled and still.
</p>

<p>
Mirka quietly reclosed the door and darted
around the corner.
</p>

<br><br>
THE SERPENTS' DEN
</h3>

<p>
Poverty, which produces the slave, breeds,
just as surely, the slaver.  Take where you
will the trail of the trafficker in women, this
rule is proven.  It is proven in puritan Boston and
protected New Orleans, in Chicago and Washington,
in Philadelphia and San Francisco, and on the
heroic scale it is nowhere more plainly proven than
in the heroic city of New York.
</p>

<p>
On Manhattan Island is, indeed, the Mother-Church,
however unconsciously organized, of the
black faith, and though, of necessity, there
spontaneously arise elsewhere congregations that reach
back to her, here is founded and established the
Congregation of the Propaganda that reaches out to
them.  Its missionaries&mdash;its women, men, and
methods&mdash;have stretched to Nome and the Canal
Zone; they are preaching their own brand of dogma
against the native versions of Buenos Ayres and
Sydney, of Shanghai and Cape Town; and within its
home city the hierarchy is entrenched by financial
strength, political power, and legal negligence.  As
an industry, it has its wholesalers and retailers; or,
as a church, its bishops sit in their national house of
peers, while its younger orders, its proselyting
priests and evangelizing deacons, perform their
especial tasks, the young appealing to the young, the
poor preying upon poverty.
</p>

<p>
The entrance to these lower orders lies, as in
most orders and most businesses, through a period
of probation: the lad of sixteen plays the rôle of
watchdog and spy for his superiors, for which he
earns an occasional fifty-cent piece, or a casual kettle
of beer, vastly increasing his income if he now and
then diverts, as he generally does, his energies to
the occupation of amateur theft.  From this stage
he is admitted, by his own efforts, to the possession
of one girl, whom he bullies into working for him
along the streets.  He may occasionally deign to
appear as a waiter in a café, and offer his woman
to its drunken habitués; but most frequently he scorns
all menial labor, for which, in fact, conditions have
utterly unfitted him.  Sometimes he increases his
slave-holdings to a trio of women, and even farms
out his victims to friends in his own or other
neighborhoods or towns: more often he delivers his
human wares to the proprietors of houses intended for
their reception, being paid in a lump sum, or on a
royalty basis; but in either case his ambition is,
naturally, to rise to the position of the large
property-holder or the political receiver of tribute.  If
he is an Italian, common consent limits his operations
to the southern end of the Bowery; if he is a Jew,
his field lies about the Houston and Essex Streets
districts; whatever his European parentage, he seeks
his fellow-countrywomen, and if he is American born
he has the freedom of Broadway.
</p>

<p>
His means are multitude.  Wherever there is
squalor seeking ease, he is there.  Wherever there
is distress crying for succor, discontent complaining
for relief, weariness sighing for rest, there is this
missionary, this "cadet," offering the quack salvation
of his temporal church.  He knows and takes
subtle advantage of the Jewish sisters sent to work
for the education of Jewish brothers; the Irish, the
Germans, the Russians, and the Syrians ground in
one or another economic mill; the restless neurotic
native-daughters untrained for work and spoiled for
play.  He is at the door of the factory when it
releases its white-faced women for a breath of night
air; he is at the cheap lunch-room where the
stenographers bolt unwholesome noonday food handed about
by underpaid waitresses; he lurks around the corner
for the servant and the shop-clerk.  He remembers
that these are girls too tired to do household work
in their evenings, too untaught to find continued
solace in books; that they must go out, that they
must move about; and so he passes his own nights
at the restaurants and theaters, the moving-picture
shows, the dancing academies, the dance-halls.  He
may go into those stifling rooms where immigrants,
long before they learn to make a half-complete
sentence of what they call the American language, learn
what they are told are American dances: the whirling
"spiel" with blowing skirts, the "half-time waltz"
with jerking hips.  He may frequent the more
sophisticated forms of these places, may even be seen
in the more expensive cafés, or may journey into the
provinces.  But he scents poverty from afar.
</p>

<p>
Where training is as yet too strong or distress
too weak to make serve the offer of partnership, the
promise of marriage usually suffices.  The thing is
done, and once done, blows and starvation perpetuate
it with the ignorant, and threats of exposure and
public shame rivet the shackles on the more knowing.
The former suffer for their darkness; the latter are
held the faster in proportion to their previous
respectability.
</p>

<p>
One has said that this church is established; in
every city it maintains its incestuous marriage to the
state.  It controls real votes by the thousands and
provides false ones by the tens of thousands.  It is
a church that may be considered to exercise the old
ecclesiastical right of trying its own offenders in its
own courts.  When the magistrates have not begun
as slavers, when they own no poor, but highly rented,
houses, leased for prostitution, when they do not
even accept tithes from the traffic, it is still largely
the traffic that elects and can defeat them.  What the
Black Church owes to the political powers for their
protection, the political powers owe to the church for
its ballots.
</p>

<p>
It was this condition that made possible the
impunity of such a deed as the Austrian Mirka had done
upon Hermann Hoffmann, the bar-keeper; that made
certain the assailant's escape, and that made of the
entire matter merely a question as to which of
several handy means should be employed to free the
slaver in the eyes of the law.  About those means
there had, however, been some debate, and so it
befell that, early on the Sunday evening following
the shooting, Rafael Angelelli sat in a recognized
New York meeting-place of the church's proselyting
order, engaged in pleasant converse with Wesley
Dyker, candidate for a magistracy.  This place was
the back-room of a saloon.  It was filled with
cigarette-smoking young missionaries, who talked shop,
and quoted prices, and discussed the prospects of a
good season in precisely the businesslike way that
men in a livestock-dealers' club talk shop, and quote
prices, and discuss the prospects of a good season.
Dyker had not at all wanted to come there, but
O'Malley had ordered, and so, making peace with
the tolerant Angelelli, he had been forced to obey.
A special counsel for the sheriff of New York had
once been a member of the legal corps of the
missionaries and so had two State Senators: O'Malley,
remembering Dyker's previous career, could see no
reason for present pride.
</p>

<p>
The room was clouded with smoke.  Waiters hurried
about serving beer from brass platters and swabbing
the small tables with damp rags.  There was
a buzz of conversation broken by that peculiar form
of laughter which responds only to obscenities, and
now and then, out of the general clamor, there arose
oaths almost technical, descriptions of women that
sounded like auctioneers' announcements in a
horse-market, and fragments of stories in which the teller
bragged of a sharp deal he had effected in capturing
a slave or in bargaining with a proprietress.
</p>

<p>
"I understand," said Dyker, with his eyelids
characteristically lowered, "that you want to see me in
regard to something about this shooting-affair of
your friend Mirka."
</p>

<p>
Angel's oily head bobbed a ready assent.
</p>

<p>
"Where's the fellow that was hurt?"
</p>

<p>
"In Bellevue."
</p>

<p>
"Is he going to die?"
</p>

<p>
"Naw; eet was only a leetle one in hees shoulder."
</p>

<p>
"Anybody else in the bar when it happened?"
</p>

<p>
"Naw."
</p>

<p>
That was better.  Wesley took a sip of beer.
</p>

<p>
"Mirka was alone, too?"
</p>

<p>
"Yas."
</p>

<p>
"Did the bar-keeper see him?"
</p>

<p>
"Naw; hees back was rounda to da door."
</p>

<p>
"There'd been a quarrel beforehand, though?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, some small word only."
</p>

<p>
"And nobody saw Mirka come back or leave the
place the second time?"
</p>

<p>
Nobody had seen him.
</p>

<p>
Then how was it that the injured man, in the
hospital, had said that Mirka had done the shooting?
</p>

<p>
Angel explained that Hermann based his accusation
partly on an uncertain and partial glimpse of
Mirka caught in the bar-mirror at the instant that
the shot was fired, but largely on the preceding
quarrel.
</p>

<p>
"This Hoffmann couldn't swear to Mirka's identity
from that mere glimpse?"
</p>

<p>
The Italian thought not.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then," said Wesley, "it all ought to be
easy enough.  Every bar-keeper knows a lot of
drunks that might want to hurt him."
</p>

<p>
Rafael shrugged.
</p>

<p>
"You can feex eet," he said.  "Meest' O'Malley
say you feex eet easy."
</p>

<p>
"But," replied Dyker, "I don't see how I can
act as Mirka's lawyer, unless it is all done quickly.
You know, I'm about to be elected magistrate."
</p>

<p>
"Poof!" said Angel, blowing a thin spiral of
blue cigarette-smoke.  "We gotta da lawyer."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"  Dyker looked up quickly, and quickly
down again.  "Then you want me&mdash;I see."
</p>

<p>
"Good."
</p>

<p>
The prospective magistrate began making rings
on the table with his wet glass.
</p>

<p>
"But I should think there were other ways.  The
man hasn't been arrested yet?"
</p>

<p>
"Naw."
</p>

<p>
"Then why need the police find him?"
</p>

<p>
"Thees O'Malley say eet looka better."
</p>

<p>
"He might jump his bail."
</p>

<p>
"Naw."
</p>

<p>
"It's often done that way."
</p>

<p>
"O'Malley say 'naw'."
</p>

<p>
"Or he might go up for trial.  There's no real
evidence against him: nobody saw the shot fired.
And besides, even if we couldn't fix things in court,
which is always easy enough, we could get him a
pardon as we did for Pud Morley or Frank Da
Silva."
</p>

<p>
But Angel would have none of these propositions.
Michael O'Malley was, it seemed, inexorable.
There had been enough bail-jumping, queer verdicts,
and pardons for a few months.  The case must
come before the new magistrate, and the new
magistrate must declare that the testimony was
not sufficient to warrant holding the prisoner for
court.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Mirka now?" asked Dyker.
</p>

<p>
"Een Philadelph'," said Angel.
</p>

<p>
"Loafing?"
</p>

<p>
"Naw.  He tooka one of heesa girls along.  I
am takin' care of dees other one."
</p>

<p>
"Can't we get hold of the Dutchman and make
him see who's back of all this?"
</p>

<p>
"Naw; dees Dutch' ees a fool."
</p>

<p>
"Won't even be bought?"
</p>

<p>
"Naw."
</p>

<p>
"And can't be scared?"
</p>

<p>
"Naw; I tell you dees Dutch' ees a damn fool."
</p>

<p>
Wesley did not like the plan; he did not like it at
all; but he was already harnessed fast, and he had
learned that it was best to follow without protest the
directing rein.  He achieved a smile.
</p>

<p>
"All right," he agreed.
</p>

<p>
The Italian's face lighted with gratification.
</p>

<p>
"You do eet?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I'll arrange it; don't worry."
</p>

<p>
"Good!  Good!  That's good!"
</p>

<p>
Angel's pleasure was so pronounced that Dyker
for a moment feared&mdash;though it would have made
small difference&mdash;lest the cadet make to the entire
company a public announcement of his promise.  He
need not, however, have worried.  Rafael was wholly
used to these legal fictions and to the etiquette that
imposed their formal observance; his delight took
the shape of an order for another pair of drinks,
and, those dispatched, he leisurely got upon his little
feet.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said he, "I go.  I hava da businesses."
</p>

<p>
He smiled wisely at the concluding word.
</p>

<p>
Wesley also rose.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have to be getting along myself," he remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but you can stay eef you feel like," said
Angel.  "I maka you know deesa mens."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks.  I do know most of them," replied
Dyker, nodding to two or three of the nearby cadets
as he spoke.  "But I have some business, too.  These
are busy times with me."
</p>

<p>
They both made their way to the saloon's side door.
</p>

<p>
"Goin' so soon?" chorused some of the habitués
as Angel moved among them.
</p>

<p>
He nodded, smiling cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
"Goin' to kop out a new skirt?" inquired one.
</p>

<p>
"Yas," responded Rafael, now with a frank,
satisfied chuckle.
</p>

<p>
"Then here's luck!" cried another.
</p>

<p>
As the health was being drunk, Dyker passed
through the door and turned, alone, into the cool
night air of the street.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding his natural bias, his severe
schooling, and his honestly cynical and cynically
limited view of this portion of his little world, he was
ashamed of what he had just seen and heard and
done, and he was disgusted.  He walked down the
avenue in the deepened shadows, for the first time
in a long while more than half inclined to ask
himself whether what he was to get was worth the price
that he had already begun to pay for it; and for
the first time, by way of answer, frankly facing the
fact that the position of a corrupt magistrate was not
much worse than that of a corrupt lawyer, and that
neither position was much worse, and both certainly
better paid, than the position in which his task had
been to render anonymous assistance to the no less
dubious course of more esteemed corporation attorneys.
</p>

<p>
He was too occupied with these reflections,
disquieting and consolatory, to observe well the persons
that passed him.  He continued his way along the
curb rather because he had started upon it than
because he at all cared about whither it led him,
much as he was continuing his progress in the
political maze in which his lot was cast.  He kept his
head bent, and so he did not see a pale-faced,
large-eyed woman that, turning a hasty corner, almost
collided with him and then suddenly drew back and
crossed the street.
</p>

<p>
There were changes in the woman's face, which
might have precluded recognition.  He had last
seen her on the eve of a surgical operation and she
had looked ill, but now, the cumulative effect of that
and many other crises sat upon her, and it was only
in her habitual gait, the swaying languid pace of
an unstudied young animal, that he might have found
enough to recall her to his memory.  But Dyker's
eyes were directed inward and so, when she turned
aside to avoid the man that she fancied she had
wronged, he did not realize that he had
almost touched elbows with the woman he had
once rescued, fresh from her dismissal from the
sacred precincts of Mrs. Ferdinand Chamberlin's
home.
</p>

<p>
She had started away from Washington Square in
the same dull pain in which she had previously left
the Ninth Street boarding-house presided over by
the stony-breasted Mrs. Alberta Turner; she had
been only a wounded dog, whose sole desire was to
find a dark corner in which she could suffer
unobserved; but slowly there reasserted itself in her
torpid brain that new impulse toward a questioning
of life which had so appalled Philip Beekman.  The
whole she could not see; her own case bulked so far
in the foreground that little else of the picture was
visible to her.  But she knew that an ill-constructed
world was against her; she concluded that all legitimate
doors were closed upon her, and she felt
gradually kindling a wrath that would end in
general reprisal.
</p>

<p>
How she chanced into Rivington Street she did
not know.  She had no clear idea as to where she
was to go, except that she must not return
to burden Katie Flanagan.  Yet, almost before she
was clearly conscious of her whereabouts, she found
herself accosted by a voice that proved to come from
the lips of Marian Lennox.
</p>

<p>
"Mary Morton!  How do you do?  Where are
you going?  Where on earth have you been?  Come
in here; I'm just getting back from a walk.  I am
so anxious to hear how you are getting on, and I
have been so disappointed because you never let me
hear from you."
</p>

<p>
The rivulet of cheerful words poured from the
calm-faced woman with unheeding force.  Each one
of them fell upon her auditor with an unintended
shock.  Mary, who had almost forgotten the
pseudonym under which she had been presented at the
Settlement, could say nothing.  She was carried up
the steps and into the house, up the stairs and into
the deserted sitting-room on the second floor; and
there she sank limply into a wicker chair beside a
magazine-littered table, tête-à-tête with her former
benefactress.
</p>

<p>
Marian, all good intentions, rested her delicate
chin upon her white hands.
</p>

<p>
"Now," she said, "I am anxious to hear all about you."
</p>

<p>
Mary, with a perplexed frown, looked hard at
the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Why, there isn't much to tell, Miss Lennox,"
she replied.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense.  Of course there is, my dear.  You
must understand that I am interested in everything
about you&mdash;in everything."
</p>

<p>
Mary's eyes sought, for a moment, the pure,
cameo-like face.  They could see no evil there, and
they could see much kindliness.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then," she hesitated, "I don't know exactly
where to begin."
</p>

<p>
"At the beginning, of course.  How do you like
your place?"
</p>

<p>
"Which place, Miss Lennox?"
</p>

<p>
"The place we sent you to."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not there no more."
</p>

<p>
"Not there?"  Marian raised her perfectly arched
brows.  "But, my dear Mary, why not?  Didn't
you like it?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't mind."
</p>

<p>
"Then you have found a better place?"
</p>

<p>
Again Mary studied her questioner.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Lennox," she said, "I guess you people
here have all sorts of girls comin' around, don't
you?"
</p>

<p>
There was a surprise in this departure, and
Marian's deep eyes mirrored it.  The questioner had
become the questioned.
</p>

<p>
"A great many kinds," she replied.  "Why do
you ask?"
</p>

<p>
"Girls that work at all sorts of things?"
</p>

<p>
"To be sure."
</p>

<p>
"And you want to help 'em?"
</p>

<p>
"We try to help them all."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I thought so.  Can you help 'em all, Miss
Lennox?"
</p>

<p>
"When they let us, I think we can."
</p>

<p>
"Then what do you do about them that hasn't
been straight?"
</p>

<p>
Marian softly caught her breath.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she said; "I&mdash;&mdash;"  She had learned, since
their last meeting, a little about the girls concerning
whom Mary was inquiring, and she had learned
much regarding the Settlement's attitude toward
them; but she had learned, also, that the work of the
place most lay with the flowers that bloomed among
the weeds, and so, "Well, you see," she lamely
continued, "Well, we do the best we can."
</p>

<p>
"What's that, please, Miss Lennox?  I've got a
particular reason for wanting to know."
</p>

<p>
Marian understood.  She spoke softly, and softly
laced and interlaced her long white fingers, resting
in her lap.
</p>

<p>
"We do the best we can, Mary," she repeated,
more confidently.  "When we have investigated the
case and are sure such a girl is sorry, or wasn't
entirely to blame, and that she means to do what is
right in the future, we make her our personal friend.
We encourage her to come here and talk to us and
get all the help possible.  We have her around to all
the entertainments&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Can she learn?" asked Mary.
</p>

<p>
"Learn?"  Marian's voice was puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"Can she go to the clubs and the classes they
talked about when I was here first?" explained
Mary.
</p>

<p>
Marian shook a doubtful head.
</p>

<p>
"You see that wouldn't do, right away, Mary,"
she said.  "We have to think of the other girls, and
we have to protect the girls that <i>are</i> straight as well
as help those that haven't been.  These are their
clubs, after all, and they wouldn't like it, if they
knew.  It wouldn't be just for us to deceive them,
and they have the first claim on our protection."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
It was the hardest question that Marian Lennox
had ever had put to her.  She tried to form an
answer, but though she could think of many that
seemed to her logical, she could think of none that
seemed kind.  Sympathy sprang to her eyes.  She
put out her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Mary!" she said.
</p>

<p>
But Mary had received her reply.
</p>

<p>
"It don't matter, Miss Lennox," she said, and
she said it so calmly and so coldly that Marian
involuntarily drew back in her chair.  "I just
wondered, that was all."
</p>

<p>
She stopped an instant.  Her hostess tried to speak
and could not, but presently the girl pursued:
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't square with you, that night you gave
me the recommedation to Mrs. Turner, Miss Lennox.
I suppose I ought to've told you all about myself,
but I had to get work, an' I knew if I told you
I wouldn't get no job.  I'd been&mdash;I'd been in a
house.  I wanted to get away, an' a man had
just got me out a little more'n a month or so
before."
</p>

<p>
"It was not exactly honest of you," said Marian.
</p>

<p>
She was sorry as soon as she had spoken, but
Mary, showing no sign of hurt or resentment, was
continuing before reparation or explanation could be
made.
</p>

<p>
Very simply she told the hard outward facts of
her story.  She did not give the history of her
capture, because her experience with Mrs. Turner, with
the homely little woman that had called at the
employment-agency, and with Philip Beekman had
shown her that this could not lessen the extent of her
contamination.  Honestly rejecting her deception of
Marian, goaded by that glimpse of Wesley Dyker
into an impulse to make, at any cost to herself, the
amend of truth for what fault she had committed,
she was still more powerfully moved by a determination
to accept without reservation the part that the
world had now assigned her, and to fight under no
colors save her own.
</p>

<p>
Marian, her fine face drawn with pain, heard the
narrative in a silence broken only when Mary had
concluded with her departure from the hospital.
The girl had mentioned no names.
</p>

<p>
"And even this one man," murmured Marian at
last, "even this man who had the courage to rescue
you&mdash;even he was a visitor at such a place?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course," said Mary, as yet unused to
the idea of any blame attaching to the mere male
patronage of slavery.  "How else could I have got
him for help?"
</p>

<p>
"But you said he was in love with that woman
who conducted the&mdash;house."
</p>

<p>
"With Miss Rose?"
</p>

<p>
"What did you call her?"
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Rose Légère she called herself, but I guess
that wasn't her name.  Yes, he was kind of in love
with her.  He was one of her favorites anyhow, but
that was just because he had a pull with the politicians,
you see.  She let him love her so's she could
work him, an' when I put him wise to that, he was
glad to help me."
</p>

<p>
Marian clinched her fist.
</p>

<p>
"The abominable cur!" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!  Not that," protested Mary.  She had
failed this man by retracting her affidavit, but she
meant to be loyal to him wheresoever she could.  His
name slipped from her with no thought of
consequences.  "It took a lot of nerve an' goodness to
do for me what Mr. Dyker done."
</p>

<p>
Marian's gaze became fixed.  She was a woman
whose whole training had shaped her against sudden
betrayal of emotion, but she needed every precept of
that training now.  She did not start, she did not
flush, but her hands moved to the arms of her chair
and gripped them hard.
</p>

<p>
"Did you say Mr. Wesley Dyker?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
Her voice did not betray her to the woman
opposite, but Mary feared lest her own desire to
defend her deliverer had betrayed him.
</p>

<p>
"That's who it was, Miss Lennox," she admitted,
adding anxiously: "But I didn't go to mention it.
</p>

<p>
"You won't tell it to no one that could use it against
him, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!"  Marian laughed a short, hard laugh
and rose to hide whatever might be seen of her
confusion.  "Oh, no," she said; "I shan't speak of
this to any enemy."
</p>

<p>
Her movement had seemed to Mary as a sign
that the interview was ending, but the laughter
chilled her.  She also rose, and stood before her
hostess.
</p>

<p>
"You don't know him?" she tremulously inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I think," said Marian, "that I used to know
somebody by some such name, but I do not know him
now.  He need not disturb himself, and when you
see him you need not disturb him by saying that you
spoke of this to me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I won't see him," Mary assured her.  "It
ain't likely I'll ever see see him again."
</p>

<p>
Marian's eyes searched her, but they detected
nothing disingenuous.
</p>

<p>
"You have quarreled?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
"No, only he wanted me to testify against Miss
Rose, an' I was too scared.  I just hid myself."
</p>

<p>
There was a simple appeal in the bare words that
brought their hearer to her better self.  Within her
there burned a new and mounting fire, but her face
was cool and her actions were reasoned.
</p>

<p>
"Mary," she said, determined to sink herself and
to be true to her code, "I am very sorry to have
heard all this.  I am sorry that I seemed harsh when
I said you had not been quite honest with us."
</p>

<p>
"But I hadn't been, Miss Lennox."
</p>

<p>
"It was not altogether your fault if you weren't,
Mary.  I begin to see that it must be rather hard,
sometimes, to be quite honest."
</p>

<p>
"It is, sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"But you have been honest now with me, and
I want to help you.  I want you to come around
here in the way I described.  I want you to come
often."
</p>

<p>
She paused, and then, as Mary did not respond,
she added:
</p>

<p>
"Will you?"
</p>

<p>
Mary's eyes were on the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think you can get me a job?" she asked.
"Do you think anyone can?"
</p>

<p>
Marian had thought nothing about it.
</p>

<p>
"Why, really, I don't know, Mary.  But I suppose
so.  Anyhow, I'll see what I can do&mdash;though
of course I shouldn't feel justified in procuring you
a position under false pretenses.  You understand
that?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mary, "I understand."
</p>

<p>
"And, at any rate, you will come around to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
Still Mary did not look up.
</p>

<p>
"You will come?" repeated Marian.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Miss Lennox," said Mary.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then: to-morrow afternoon."
</p>

<p>
Something in the girl's attitude made Marian uneasy.
She insisted on her point, but again Mary was
slow to answer, and again Marian asked:
</p>

<p>
"Will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Miss Lennox."
</p>

<p>
"At five o'clock, Mary."
</p>

<p>
"I'll try, Miss Lennox."
</p>

<p>
"Promise."
</p>

<p>
Mary stepped to the door.  She looked up and put
out her hand, but, although Marian saw this, and
started to respond, the settlement-worker's hand fell
back to her side.  Mary seemed first to observe and
then not at all to have observed it.
</p>

<p>
"I promise," she said quietly, and left the room
and the house.
</p>

<p>
Inside, Marian was looking at her hand as if,
because it had refused to seek that of the woman
who, she concluded, had shared Rose Légère's
intimacy with Dyker, it had been scorched by the new
passion aflame in her own heart.  Outside, Mary,
tramping the evening street, saw, in her memory of
that hand withheld, a hand pointing her definitely
away from the keeping of her promise, pointing her
onward down the street as the place where, for the
future, she must live and work.

<h3>
XXIII
<br><br>
KATIE'S DAY
</h3>

<p>
The election came, and went in just the way
that everybody expected it to go.  Wesley
Dyker's political craft, along with many
others, was carried on the inrushing waves of his
party's success to the haven where he had desired
it to rest, and the prosperity that had raised the
price of votes to five dollars apiece immediately
resumed its unostentatious levy upon the voters against
the next election.  The defeated candidates forgot
their so recent denunciations and congratulated their
victorious opponents; the victorious opponents
forgot their tinsel pledges and resumed the safe and
sure business of government for revenue only, and
the population of New York, like the population
of most cities, forgot all the good things that had
been pledged it, and turned its energies to the
everyday task of taking what it could get.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Carrie Berkowicz, homely and hopeless,
pursued, with a dogged earnestness, the path
that conditions had hewn for her, and always she
pursued it not alone.  As the waiting beast prowls
behind the slowly weakening traveler lost in a jungle,
as the bird of prey circles calmly above the wounded
man in the forest, as both beast and bird stand by
until there comes the moment when strength can no
longer oppose them, so, day after day, rarely speaking,
but always watching, there followed in this girl's
footsteps the dark young man with curling hair and
shining teeth, who had accosted her on Waverley
Place.  He seemed to watch for her morning entrance
upon the street, and to be the last to see her
when she dragged her wasting body into the
tenement at night.  Much of the time he dogged her
like a foul shadow.  She would pass him in a
doorway, she would see him lounging at a corner, she
would catch glimpses of him across a crowded street.
There were times when she feared to look up lest
she should have to answer that prosperous leer and
ornate bow; there were others, at last, when, as his
well-fed body brushed by her, she almost plucked
at his sleeve with her hungry hands.  He never
stopped, but sometime, she knew, he would stop; he
never said more than "Good-morning" or "Good-evening,",
but sometime, sometime soon, he would,
she knew, say more.
</p>

<p>
And meanwhile, too, the politically unaffected
routine of the Lennox department-store began
gradually to provide for one of its victims at least
the sense of approaching variety: Katie Flanagan
realized that the end of her usefulness&mdash;as that
phrase is termed by employers, boarding-school
principals, and others in authority&mdash;was rapidly nearing.
She managed to avoid the immaculate Mr. Porter
for one week, and, but for her worry over the
condition of the wounded Hermann, would have had
moments when the sport was amusing.  As the
taskmaster paused at her counter one time during the
second week, she achieved a sick aunt, who sufficed
to account for her occupied evenings.  But when the
days and the nights dragged by with no change for
either the better or the worse in the condition of
this bed-ridden relative, and when the girl's invention
began to flag, and her spirit to tire, Mr. Porter's
glance grew more and more searching, his manner
less and less warm, and Katie knew that she must
soon retreat or surrender.
</p>

<p>
"I have not seen much of you lately, Miss Flanagan,"
remarked Mr. Porter as, late one afternoon,
he came mincing to the counter where she
stood.
</p>

<p>
"I've been here pretty regular, Mr. Porter,"
answered Katie.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Porter caressed a gray side-whisker.
</p>

<p>
"Um," said he.  "I presume, then, that your
grandmother is no worse."
</p>

<p>
"It's me aunt, sir," rejoined Katie, with the
mental addition: "You didn't catch me that time, you
ould tom-cat."  And she added: "The good woman's
some better, thanks."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Mr. Porter, and, indeed, his cold
gaze seemed to see a great deal more than he was
inclined to mention.  "At this rate of improvement,
I hope you will soon find time to consider the matter
we discussed that day in my office."
</p>

<p>
"I hope that, Mr. Porter," smiled Katie.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," concluded Mr. Porter, turning from her&mdash;he
always turned away when he was most significant.
"I hope so, too, for I can't well keep your
case under advisement much longer."
</p>

<p>
Several of the salesgirls nearby laughed openly,
and Katie, when he was out of sight, looked at them
with a grimace half sad, half mocking.
</p>

<p>
The next morning she was transferred to a
bargain-counter for the day.
</p>

<p>
What the outcome might have been there is no
imagining.  What it was depended, at any rate in
part, upon the fact that, on what proved to be her
last day at the shop, she had come to work with a
tired body and an aching head.  She had sat up
half the night in a long endeavor to persuade Carrie
to leave the futile battle of the strikers and turn to
other employment; and, when Carrie had rejected
all proposals on the ground that, though the fight
was lost, she knew no other sort of work, Katie had
spent about all the remainder of the dark hours in
an attempt to convince her roommate that the Irish
girl's wages were enough to support both of them
for some time to come.  The result, so far as went
her conduct at the store, was a temper ready to
explode with the first spark, and that spark came when,
in midafternoon, a nervous woman, who persisted
in examining everything and buying nothing,
interpreted Katie's lassitude as indifference and so
reported it to the floor-walker.
</p>

<p>
Katie was sent for to come to Mr. Porter's office.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Porter looked up from the light at his desk,
and then down again.  He stroked a whisker.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, Miss Flanagan," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," replied Katie, "I can take it just as
well standin'."
</p>

<p>
"Take what?" asked Mr. Porter.
</p>

<p>
"Anythin' at all you have to say," said Katie.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Porter continued to look at his desk and, by
the name of "Miss Flanagan," addressed it severely.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Flanagan," he said, "you have again been
reported to me for discourtesy to a customer.  The
other case had not yet been adjusted.  It might have
been adjusted had not your cousin&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Me aunt," prompted Katie.
</p>

<p>
"Your aunt," frowned Mr. Porter to his desk,
"had not your aunt been so disinclined to recover."
</p>

<p>
"She was gettin' absent treatment from a bad doctor."
</p>

<p>
"I know nothing of that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I think meself it was Malicious Animal Magnetism."
</p>

<p>
"Please do not interrupt," said Mr. Porter, shaking
his whiskers at the desk.  "I say that the previous
case was not adjusted, though it might have
been, if your mother had not remained so ill."
</p>

<p>
"Me aunt."
</p>

<p>
"Your aunt, if you prefer it.  Now comes this
second case, and really, I am curious to know whether
you can suggest anything that will make me regard
it with the smallest degree of lenience."
</p>

<p>
He looked again at the desk, as if the desk were
the case he had referred to, but neither the desk nor
Katie answered.
</p>

<p>
"If you cannot," he at last concluded, "I see no
course but one for me to pursue."
</p>

<p>
Katie folded her arms across her breast and tossed
her black head.
</p>

<p>
"There's only one thing I can think of," said she,
and waited.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Porter breathed hard.
</p>

<p>
"And what," he inquired, still without looking at
her, "is that?"
</p>

<p>
Katie took a soft step forward.  She rested her
hands upon the arm of his desk and leaned her face
toward him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know?" she asked in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Porter shot, from the corner of his eyes, one
of his crooked glances at her.
</p>

<p>
"I am not quite sure," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Then," replied Katie, "I'll tell you.  The only
one thing I can think of that'd get you to let me
off is the only one you can think of yourself&mdash;<i>an'
that's the one I won't do!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Her voice, which had begun so softly, ended in
a loud note.  Her hands, which had been open,
clinched.  Her body, which had been relaxed,
stiffened.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Porter sprang back from her, looked at her
with hot fright in his usually cool eyes, and then
shrank as far away as his desk-armchair would
permit.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Flanagan," he spluttered, "not so loud,
please!  You will alarm the store."
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could alarm it!" said Katie.
</p>

<p>
"But what&mdash;what&mdash;I don't understand&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you do understand, all right, all right,
Mr. Porter.  I know what you want; I've known it all
along, an' if I hadn't liked to make a fool of you,
I'd have told you long since what I tell you now:
<i>You won't get it!</i>"
</p>

<p>
If it were possible for Mr. Porter to grow whiter
than his habit, he grew whiter then.
</p>

<p>
"I shall&mdash;I shall ring for assistance!" he protested.
</p>

<p>
"No you won't; you won't dare; you'll sit there,
an' write me out a recommendation an' an order for
me pay&mdash;if your hand ain't shakin' too much, an'
if it is, I'll write it for you."
</p>

<p>
And he did write it.  After one look at her, he
wrote it without a word, and "without," as Katie
carefully stipulated, "any dockin' for the last
offense," and as she left him she delivered one
Parthian bolt.
</p>

<p>
"Remember me to the girl you start after in the
mornin'," she said; "an' when you go home to-night,
just give me grandmother-mother-aunt-cousin's best
regards to your grown-up great-grandchildren."
</p>

<p>
The taste in which her revolution expressed itself
may have been as doubtful as the courage that
inspired it was certain; but, had Mr. Porter been able
to see into her mind as she hurried homeward, he
would have been gratified at what he found there.
The excitement had gone, and with it the bravery.
She had preserved her individual ideals, but she now
realized at what a cost she had preserved them.
Against masculine attack it was sometimes inspiriting
to defend herself, but to the slow and continuous
advance of penury she well knew that, at last, she
must succumb.
</p>

<p>
She passed her ugly little parish-church, and,
remembering that she had missed her last confession,
entered its forbidding doors.
</p>

<p>
The swinging portal closed softly behind her.  It
shut out the glare of the day, it shut out the noises
of the street, and it seemed to shut out the entire
malicious power of the world.  Inside the cruel
sunshine became kindly shade and comforting candle-light;
the only sound was the occasional footfall of
an unseen suppliant, and on the distant high altar,
shimmering and white at the end of the long
perspective of the empty aisle, there rested the power
she believed more powerful than all on earth beside.
</p>

<p>
She made her confession&mdash;not the easy and formal
confession of the strong, who need it most, but
the frank probing question and full reply of the
weak, who can profit by it least&mdash;and at its end she
received not only the benediction that she traced to
Heaven, but the shrewd advice that came direct from
the big heart of a worldly-wise and beneficent man.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, father," she added to the words
of the ritual, as she rose to go, "I'll do me best to
stick it out, but times be when it's powerful
hard."
</p>

<p>
The experience had encouraged her, but, when she
came at last into her barren home, there fell a blow
that shook to its foundations the structure of hope
which she had so briefly reared.  On the bare table
was a single sheet of paper, and on the paper was
written:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"Dear Katie:&mdash;I have gone away.  There was no use in saying
good-by, for that would only have hurt both of us, and I could
not have made you see that I was right not to board here any
longer at your expense, any more than you could make me see
last night that you were right on your side.  Pretty soon I'll come
to see you and bring the money I owe you, but I can't ever pay
you back all your other goodness, although I would give my right
arm to do it.
</p>

<p class="letter">
"Another thing.  By the time you get this letter Hermann will
be to see you at the store.  I was around to Bellevue yesterday,
and we kept it as a surprise for you that he was coming out
to-day.  I hope by this time you two will have fixed it all up; but
if you haven't, well, I never talked to you about it much before,
but I feel I must say something now, because I seem to know
more about life than I used to: take him, Katie dear, for there
are only horrors ahead for any girls like you and me if we don't
marry.  He's a fine man and you love him, and the two of you
will do better together than you can do apart.
</p>

<p class="letter">
"Now, good-by.  Don't please bother to hunt for me&mdash;I won't
be on picket-duty any more, but <i>I am all right</i>.
</p>

<p class="letter">
  "Lovingly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"CARRIE."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Katie Flanagan put down the note.  She went to
the narrow window and gazed blindly at the unsightly
wing of the tenement across the narrow court
outside.
</p>

<p>
"All right?" she said, the paper crumpling in
her tightened hand.  "All right?  The poor girl's
got no money an' no job.  I know what she's thinking
an' there's no good followin'.  'All right,' she
says!  Dear God, pity her: she means, 'all
wrong'!"
</p>

<p>
Katie felt too deeply for her lost comrade to think
much, if at all, of that portion of the note which
touched her own interest.  Her eyes clouded; her
shoulders shook; she fell upon her knees before the
window-sill, and it was there that Hermann's strong
arms went about her neck.
</p>

<p>
Even then, glad as she was to have him back
again, she could do little but sob brokenly with her
cheek against his breast, while he told her how he
had gone to the store, learned of her dismissal, and
come at once to the tenement, not pausing to knock
when he heard her sobs.  He comforted her as best
he could, but it was some time before any comfort
availed.
</p>

<p>
All had ended well for Hermann, but all had not
easily so ended.  His wound had proved relatively
slight, and he was sound and whole again: but, the
day before his dismissal from the hospital, Schleger
had waited upon him shamefacedly to confess that
the rulers of the ward, dissatisfied with the
bar-keeper's Laodicean attitude toward their political
labors, and urged by Mirka's friends, had forbidden
his re-engagement in the saloon.  Ludwig had been
sorry, but helpless, and then, after exacting a score
of promises, had disclosed his plan to open incognito
a grocery-store on the West Side, himself remaining
in charge of the saloon and Hoffmann appearing,
on a good salary, as the owner of the new venture.
</p>

<p>
Katie looked up at him with eyes shining blue
through a dispersing mist of tears.
</p>

<p>
"An' what about the dirty Dago that shot you?"
she inquired.
</p>

<p>
Hermann smiled broadly.  His face was thinner
and not so ruddy as once, but it was cheerful still
and more determined than of old.
</p>

<p>
"The Austrian?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the same thing," said she.
</p>

<p>
"Ach, vell, I guess ve von't do nussing about him."
</p>

<p>
"You won't be lettin' him go?"
</p>

<p>
"Vhy not?  Dere's none to swear fur me and
a hun'red to swear fur him.  I kind of belief
Schleger gif me de new blace as brice fur keepin'
quiet, so dere's nussing to gain und efferysing to
lose."
</p>

<p>
At first she would not hear of it, and she used
her opposition to this dropping of the charge against
Mirka as if it were an argument properly formed
to oppose the next scheme that he proposed to her.
But he had found her in her moment of weakness
when he had come to her in his hour of strength
renewed.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said firmly, "und dis evenin' ve'll be
married.  I got der license; I stopped at der church;
Father Kelly's vatin'&mdash;dis evenin', Katie."
</p>

<p>
The world was slipping from beneath her feet.
She did not answer.
</p>

<p>
"In two year'," he went on, "one part of dot
store ve'll own.  Katie, it's our chance; und in de
meanvhile, if der Herr Gott sends der babies&mdash;und
pray Gott he vill&mdash;dey von't at least do no vorse
as ve hof done."
</p>

<p>
He drew her tighter, but she twisted in his arms
and got free, so that he held only one of her firm
hands.  They stood there face to face, between them
the unfathomable chasm of sex, their feet trembling
at its brink.
</p>

<p>
Across the areaway the straight shafts of the
setting sun caught the dirty little window-panes of the
nearby squalid rooms and turned them to a shining
glory.  The rays were reflected into Katie's own
room; they burnished the cheap paper into cloth of
gold, they touched the floor and gilded it, they made
of the rickety table a thing of splendor, and of the
worn chairs fairy thrones.  Hermann's blonde head
was crowned with a halo, and as he looked at the
girl, against the background of those yellow
windows like a Madonna against the background that
the Etruscan painters loved, he saw in her eyes what
he had never seen before.
</p>

<p>
In the momentary struggle the coils of her black
hair had loosened and fallen below her waist.  They
framed a face no longer strong with restraint,
handsome from the flush of battle against the world, no
longer set and self-reliant, but a face through which
shone the light of the life-force, the motive-power
of the universe, a beautiful face, white, frightened,
wonderful.
</p>

<p>
"Can&mdash;can you really love me?"
</p>

<p>
She scarcely said the words.  Rather her lips
formed them with no voice behind.  But he had
heard her before her lips so much as moved.
</p>

<p>
"Ach," he cried, "I hof alvays lofed you, Katie,
but now it is somesing new und more.  Katie, I sink&mdash;I
belief sings I neffer belief before, und I sink
it must be der blessing of Gott dot I can <i>see</i> in you."
</p>

<p>
"An' there won't be anny other woman?"
</p>

<p>
"You are <i>all</i> vomen, Katie."
</p>

<p>
She raised her head.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Hermann," she said, "I think I will be
all women for you.  I will be all you want.  I will
work an' share, good luck an' bad.  I never before
was glad I knew how to work, but now I <i>will</i> be all
you want&mdash;all, <i>all</i>!"
</p>

<p>
He put her hand to his lips, and held it there an
instant: Fifth Avenue does these things, casually, no
better than the Bowery, when the Bowery has a mind
for them.
</p>

<p>
"Katie," he whispered.
</p>

<p>
She took her hand away.  She tried to laugh a
little, but the laughter, clear and silvery, caught
suddenly in her throat.  Her mouth twisted, and she
raised the hand and put her lips where his had been.
</p>

<p>
Reeling with the tremor of that sight, his arms
recaptured her, and this time held her fast.  She
swayed and yielded.  Her own arms answered his,
and his lips met, for the first time freely, the lips
she had so bravely kept for him.
</p>

<p>
The case against Mirka was then and there
dismissed, and the High Court handed down a final
decision <i>in re</i> Hoffmann <i>vs.</i> Flanagan.

XXIV
<br><br>
MARIAN'S WAY
</h3>

<p>
Wesley Dyker looked with unaffected
approval about the second-story front
room in Rivington Street.  He saw the
calmly colored walls, the excellent mats upon the
floor, the ordered writing-desk and, near the center,
the heavy library-table, covered with carefully piled
magazines.
</p>

<p>
"Hello!" he said, nodding easily to the woman
that stood motionless before him.
</p>

<p>
The woman's answer was not ready, but Dyker,
whose eyes were on surroundings almost as animate,
pursued:
</p>

<p>
"Upon my word, you have it rather cozy here,
considering the neighborhood.  I'm not half so well
fixed myself.  I'm glad to see that, Marian, and
I'm more than glad to see you."
</p>

<p>
He raised his heavy lids to look at her.  He had
resolved when, a short while before, she had sent
for him, to make no mention of their long
separation.  He was sure that the sending meant he was
to have a chance to recall to her the superior wisdom
that had expressed itself in his advice against
working among the poor; but of the time that had elapsed
since that advice was given he had meant to say
nothing.  Always he had confidently expected this
moment, and, now that it had come, she must find
him prepared.  He put out his hand.
</p>

<p>
But Marian was thinking of how, in this same
room, she had said good-by to Mary.  She
compressed her lips a moment before answering, and,
when she did answer, it was only to say, quite calmly:
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to shake hands with you, Wesley."
</p>

<p>
Day and night the words that Mary had so innocently
dropped concerning Dyker had stirred the fire
in Marian's breast.  Supposing that her protégée
had shared with Rose the easy caresses of Wesley,
even at a time when Marian had been on the point of
accepting them, the failure of that protégée to return
to the Settlement for aid or consolation had made
Marian the prey to a hundred contending emotions.
She was glad that Mary had not come back, because
Mary adrift meant Mary suffering.  She was sorry
that Mary had not come back, because she wanted
to ask the girl so many things that she had at first
neglected to ask.  She doubted Mary and was
ashamed of her doubts; she doubted Dyker and was
still ashamed.  One thought tore at another, and all
tore at her heart.
</p>

<p>
On entering the Settlement she had left Dyker in
a proud anger that forbade her acting upon his offer
to come to her whenever she should send for him;
on dismissing Mary she had so framed her promise
of secrecy that she might repeat to Wesley the
unfortunate woman's unconscious accusation; and on
twisting and turning the reptilian thing over in her
mind, she said in one breath that she could not send
for Dyker and could not be at peace unless she did
send.  The fiercest passion that a conventional woman
has is the passion for the knowledge that will most
likely clinch her unhappiness.  Marian was certain
that she must know the truth, and she told herself
that she was certain of but one fact beside: that
she did not love this man; that she had never loved
him&mdash;and, presumably because of that, she had at
last, on this day shortly after the election,
incontinently telephoned to him to come to Rivington Street.
</p>

<p>
She had said to herself that it was unfair to
condemn him unheard.  She had replied to herself that
she did not care enough about him either to condemn
or to acquit.  She had ended by the realization that,
deny it as she might, the fact of condemnation
remained; and she had inclined solely toward the attitude
of impartial justice until, in the briefest possible
time after receiving her message, Dyker had entered
this room.  Then, immediately, her mood had once
more changed, as it was to change so often during
the ensuing interview; she had left the bench and
had become the prosecutor.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps Dyker's appearance was in part to blame
for this.  She had, of course, not seen him since
that summer parting; it is seldom pleasant for a
woman to find that separation from her has left no
scar upon an admirer, and it is always annoying to
a district-attorney to detect no consciousness of guilt
in the countenance of the accused; yet Dyker had
come into her presence with a buoyant step and a
ready smile.  The pressure of campaigning had
lessened, though it could not wholly check, the progress
of his dissipations, and his face still flaunted
the tokens of its former glory.  His eyes were not
noticeably more timid than of old, and his mouth
was, as of old, hidden.  Add to this the pleasure,
still fresh, of his election, and the satisfaction of a
man fancying himself just placed in a position to
say "I told you so" to the woman he loves, and it
will be seen that Magistrate Dyker, if not at his
best, had been at least in a moment of expansion.
</p>

<p>
And now she had said that she would not take
his hand!  He could scarcely believe his ears.
</p>

<p>
"You don't want&mdash;I am afraid I do not understand
you, Marian," he said.
</p>

<p>
Her great brown eyes looked steadily into his
puzzled gaze.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, please," she responded.
</p>

<p>
Mechanically, he drew a deep wicker chair to the
window, and obeyed her.
</p>

<p>
She sat opposite him and, for fully a minute, while
with galloping brain he watched her, she looked
through the glass at crowded, shuffling Rivington
Street.
</p>

<p>
"It is simple enough, Wesley," she at last
resumed.  "Before I can think of renewing anything
like my old friendly attitude toward you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Your friendly attitude!"
</p>

<p>
"It was scarcely more than that.  Before I can
renew it, there is something that must be explained."
</p>

<p>
Dyker's own attitude was still that of the average
lover, and the average lover cannot see beyond his
own shadow.
</p>

<p>
"Oh,"&mdash;he was momentarily relieved and prepared,
in consequence, to show a proper magnanimity&mdash;"you
needn't explain, Marian!  I knew you would
find that I was right, and that this was no place for
you.  I appreciate perfectly how you feel: you have
been disappointed and disillusioned, and it is like
you handsomely to want to confess that you were
wrong.  But let's merely consider that done, and
say no more about it."
</p>

<p>
He ended in a warmth of good feeling; but
the did not seem inclined to accept this proffer,
and, as he paused, he wondered what was in her
gaze.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said, "you are not quite correct in
your surmise.  I have been disappointed and
disillusioned.  I have been disappointed in one of the
people among whom I have been working; but I
have been disillusioned in regard to you."
</p>

<p>
She stopped.  He began to guess now what was
back of those calm eyes of hers.  Disillusioned in
regard to him?  At the first breath it seemed
incredible, but at the next his mind filled with the
ghosts of his experience, the grim figures that
compose the pageant of that real life of a man, upon
which he never raises the curtain for the feminine
eyes most dear to him.
</p>

<p>
"In regard to me?" he echoed.  He was wondering,
in hidden panic, which especial image had been
revealed to her, and he sought defense in general
denial.  "You have been listening to East Side
neighborhood gossip, Marian, and I shouldn't have
believed it of you.  You have heard one of the
hundreds of groundless ante-election libels that are the
common ammunition used against anyone in politics."
</p>

<p>
Her face, always fair, was gently tinted.
</p>

<p>
"What I have heard," she replied, "I heard from
somebody that has nothing to do with politics."
</p>

<p>
"Down here," insisted Dyker, still seeking to
dislodge the enemy and force it into the open field of
recognition, "down here all the men have something
to do with politics."
</p>

<p>
"This was a woman, Wesley."
</p>

<p>
He had feared that.  He had feared it when she
first spoke of coming to the Settlement.  But he
wasted no time in such thought; he must, before he
committed himself, discover which of several
possible women, was concerned.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," he laughed, "the women are mixed up
in political gossip, too; or, at any rate," he added,
"they are always glad to repeat what their menfolk
don't hesitate to tell them."
</p>

<p>
"The woman I refer to was a part of the thing
she told."
</p>

<p>
Marian said it softly, but her white throat
trembled.
</p>

<p>
Dyker looked at her swiftly, and as swiftly lowered
his eyes.  Instantly now he guessed what it was
that she had heard; an instant more and he thought
the thing improbable.  Then, resolved at all
events not to approach self-betrayal by showing
his intuition, he assumed the point of view of
the lawyer.
</p>

<p>
"Marian," he said, pulling at his mustache that
she might see&mdash;as she did&mdash;that his hand was steady,
"is this fair?  Is it right to condemn me on a
charge of which I know nothing and because of
evidence of which I haven't heard a syllable?"
</p>

<p>
"No," she answered, "it isn't fair.  That is why
I sent for you."
</p>

<p>
He bit his lip, but faced her.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, "what is it?"
</p>

<p>
Steadily she met his renewed gaze until his eyes
failed her.
</p>

<p>
Even then her own eyes, never wavering, could
find in him not enough to determine her.  The desire
to get at the truth, whatever the truth might be,
was plying its angry whip upon her shoulders.
When Mary had spoken, Marian had received the
intelligence as innocently imparted fact.  But now
the man before her gave nothing that her inexperience
could set down as a sign of what she considered
a great sin.
</p>

<p>
"Wesley," she began, leaning towards him, "the
girl that told me this told it inadvertently.  More
than that, she did not even know that I had ever
heard of you.  She did not want to hurt you: she
was grateful to you, because you had rescued her."
</p>

<p>
His intuition, then, had not failed him: it was
Violet.
</p>

<p>
"Why," he smiled, his heart heavy with the fear
of losing Marian's love, his lips still sparring for
a more open lead, "I am afraid I'm no knight-errant,
Marian, to go about rescuing damsels in distress."  But
he did not like the sound of the phrase,
and, seeing that she liked it no better, he explained:
"You surely remember how I feel about these poor
women."
</p>

<p>
"But she said that your politics brought you into
touch with the worst sort of them."
</p>

<p>
Marian paused there to give him another chance,
but his only protest was:
</p>

<p>
"Not my politics.  The duties of my profession,
before I was elected a magistrate, sometimes made
it necessary to defend such women.  You must have
known that.  There was no dishonor there."
</p>

<p>
"And my informant added," continued Marian,
"that you used your political influence to gain their
friendship, perhaps even to protect them, and"&mdash;she
felt the depths before her; her cheeks went
hot; her brown eyes filled&mdash;"and certainly
to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She faltered.
</p>

<p>
He felt it and looked up with anger in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"To what?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
She clasped her damp hands tight.
</p>

<p>
"To live with them," she said.
</p>

<p>
Though he had expected the implication, he had
hardly expected so close an approach to the specific,
and therefore the start to which it behooved him
to give way was not altogether disingenuous.
</p>

<p>
"Marian!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
She bent her head.
</p>

<p>
"Do you believe that?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The accusation uttered, sick uncertainty gripped
and tossed her again.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what to believe."
</p>

<p>
"But how can you think I would be capable of
such things?  The girl lied."
</p>

<p>
Her judgment swayed dizzily.  Between word
and word she was now for and now against him.
</p>

<p>
"I can't think of any motive that this girl might
have to lie," she said.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know what motive she has?" returned
Dyker, realizing in what good stead his
training as a pleader of bad cases might stand him.
"How do you know what political enemies of mine
may have sent her to you?  You say that, on her
own confession, she is a vile woman&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I did not say that."
</p>

<p>
"You said she charged herself with being part
of this alleged business.  You confessed that you
were disappointed in her personally.  What possible
credit can be given to the story of a woman
that begins by admitting such abominations?"
</p>

<p>
Marian tried to speak, but indecision choked her.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you, you were tricked," he pursued, with
a glib rapidity that she did not know whether to
attribute to innocence or guilt.  "I may have lost
a case for some friend of this girl.  I may have
won a suit against one of her hangers-on.  There are
men in the lower sort of politics, I'm ashamed to
say, that don't hesitate to use such tools, and I have
offended a good many of them.  Before you considered
this story true, don't you feel that you should
have thought of one of these explanations?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," Marian faltered.  The relentless
tide of her emotions now set in again in his favor.
Mary had told her story so calmly, with so little
feeling concerning her own sufferings, that Marian
kept wondering if it might not have been an invention.
She was sure that, all along, somewhere in
her heart, she had wanted to think the best of him;
wanted, despite her accusing jealousy, to acquit him.
"I don't know," she repeated despairingly; "but"&mdash;and
the tide began to flow once more&mdash;"unless I
can be certain of her motive for lying to me, don't
you see, Wesley, don't you see that I must have
proof of your innocence from you?"
</p>

<p>
She looked at him in wide appeal.  The undertow
had caught her, and she was crying for help from
shore.  She knew now that she loved him, and she
had learned the ultimate tragedy of love: that love
and mistrust may be one.
</p>

<p>
"How can I know anything?" she went on.
"How can I be sure of anything?  How can I
understand such a world as this?  It seems as if all
the earth was lying to me, and as if all the earth
could lie and still look honest.  I trusted the girl;
I trusted you.  I beg of you to prove to me that
I was right only when I trusted you.  Wesley,"&mdash;she
almost extended her arms to him&mdash;"tell me that
you didn't do it!"
</p>

<p>
Dyker saw his advantage, but decided that the
way to keep it was to be firm.  He spoke quickly,
yet coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Who was this woman?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I ought to tell you?" she pleaded.
</p>

<p>
"Ought to tell me?  Why, Marian, how else
am I to prove what you ask me to prove?  If you
are to be at all fair with me, how can you start
by hiding the false witnesses against me?"
</p>

<p>
He was right, she felt.
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever hear," she asked, "of Mary Morton?"
</p>

<p>
Too late to weigh his words he remembered the
name that the girl whom he had called Violet had
signed to her affidavit.  Before that recollection was
clear to him, he made his reply in the deceit that is
the refuge of all the confused.
</p>

<p>
"I never did."
</p>

<p>
"You are sure?"
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely";&mdash;he had to keep it up now&mdash;"although,
if she is the sort of woman she says she is,
she probably has as many aliases as a safe-cracker."
</p>

<p>
"But this girl&mdash;I should think you would not
forget her if you had ever known her: she must have
been good-looking once.  She has blue eyes and
brown hair.  You could see from her face that she
has suffered, but you could see that she used to be
almost beautiful.  She has the walk of a queen."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know her."
</p>

<p>
"Think."&mdash;Marian was still intent upon
certainty.&mdash;"When I saw her she was both times
dressed alike, though on her second visit her clothes,
first new, had grown a little shabby.  She wore a
cloak&mdash;I forget its color, but it was dark&mdash;and a
beaver hat.  She&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He knew those clothes; he had reason to; but his
interruption was in strict accord with his previous
denial:
</p>

<p>
"There are thousands of women answering that
vague description.  I am sure, however, that I don't
know this one."
</p>

<p>
Marian did not observe that, on his own showing,
his assurance was without foundation.  Her words
had brought Mary vividly before her and, for a
minute, she well-nigh forgot her own distress in the
misery of that figure.
</p>

<p>
"She has had a great deal of trouble," said
Marian.  "Why, from what she told me, these girls
must be worse treated than the blacks in the Congo;
they must be far worse off than our own American
negro slaves used to be."
</p>

<p>
"No doubt&mdash;if what she said was true.  But I
know it was not true.  My profession has made me
see a great deal of these poor women, and I know
that if they are slaves it is because they want to
be."  He waved away the whole matter with a toss of
his hand.  He wanted some information, and he
did not want to show why he wanted it.  "That all
goes to prove that if it was she who told you this
foul story about me, then the story was that of a
born liar," he declared.  "You say she was here
twice.  What were the circumstances?"
</p>

<p>
She told him.
</p>

<p>
He breathed more freely.  He had only to
convince Marian and get her to quit her work in
disgust before further gossip should reach her.
</p>

<p>
"And so you don't know her?" she concluded.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Nor Mrs. Rose Légère?"
</p>

<p>
"I certainly know of that person," he said&mdash;it
was the part of wisdom to admit some knowledge.
"Nobody that knows anything about our police-courts,
as I have had to know, can be entirely ignorant
of her.  She is one of the most notorious women
in New York.  I know a great deal about her, but,
except for one occasion, when I saw her in a
station-house, I have never set eyes on her in my life."
</p>

<p>
He spoke with such precision that Marian caught
a gratified breath.
</p>

<p>
"Is she another Settlement visitor?" inquired
Wesley, devoutly hoping that no miracle of reformation
had, since their last meeting, been wrought upon
Rose.
</p>

<p>
"No, she is not.  It was she that was said to
have been one of your&mdash;your friends, until she made
friends with your political enemies.  The girl that
told me was, of course, the Mary Morton I have
mentioned.  She said that you were intimate with
this Mrs. Légère, and I understood that even
Mary&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Dyker was genuinely glad to find some accusation
that he could deny with truth.
</p>

<p>
"Never!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
Something in that word and his utterance of it
made her look at him hard.
</p>

<p>
"She didn't want to tell the story," Marian
insisted.  "I got it from her.  How could it have
been the result of malice or a plot?  Didn't I tell
you that she said you had rescued her from the
Légère woman's house?"
</p>

<p>
Dyker reflected.  He wished that he had been as
sweeping in his discrediting of Violet, under the
pseudonym of Mary Morton, as he had been in
his discrediting of Rose.  Failing that, he might
even have explained this rescue and have become
something of a hero.  Both opportunities were,
however, gone.  He must make the best of what
remained.
</p>

<p>
"Marian," he said, speaking slowly, quite calmly,
and with no small appearance of sincerity of purpose,
"I needn't bring you any proof of this Légère
woman's bad character&mdash;the qualities of that
character you yourself know&mdash;and as for this Morton
girl, I can only fall back on what I have already
pointed out to you.  You say she confesses her evil
life: how can you, then, credit anything an
admittedly abandoned creature may have told you?"
</p>

<p>
"Can't the worst of women tell the truth sometimes?"
</p>

<p>
"Practically never."
</p>

<p>
"But,"&mdash;Marian passed a weary hand across her
forehead&mdash;"how could this girl be in a position to
know what she says she knows, if she hadn't led just
the kind of life that you say makes her an inevitable
liar?"
</p>

<p>
It was an excellent sort of answer.  Dyker tossed
his head.
</p>

<p>
"I am hurt, Marian," he said.  "I thought you
had some faith in me; I thought you knew me.  I
don't see how you can persist in this attitude&mdash;how
you can say these things.  Why, I have been in
your house: I have known you and your father;
whereas these people&mdash;Marian, I love you; why
should I lie to you?"
</p>

<p>
She had been keeping her hand upon her forehead,
but she lowered it now to her eyes, where it was
joined by its mate.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," she moaned.  "That's just it:
I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"Then what," he asked, "can I do to convince
you?  I won't upbraid you; I won't be harsh.  My
sane course would be to pay no attention to
accusations from such a character as this Mary Morton,
and your sane course would be to pay no attention
to them.  But I know how things are in this
neighborhood; I know the bad atmosphere you have been
breathing ever since you came down here.  Long
ago I told you exactly what would happen; I foresaw
it all.  I told you when you insisted on going
into this work that these women would poison your
mind, distort your vision, make you doubt all that
is best in life.  Apparently, they have succeeded;
but I don't speak of that.  Marian, unless it was
in some police-court&mdash;perhaps at the time I saw Rose
Légère&mdash;I never saw this girl in my life.  I don't
understand her enmity any better than you do.  It
may spring from some imagined wrong to one of
her friends, or it may be a political plot.  But,
except as it affects your regard for me, I don't care
anything about it.  All that I do care about, all that
I do want to accomplish is to restore you to a normal
view of things, get you out of these foul mental
and material surroundings, and bring you back to
your own proper world.  I want to do this and to
make you know the truth concerning myself.  Tell
me what will bring this about, and I'll do it without
a moment's loss of time."
</p>

<p>
He thought that, in the nature of the case, there
was nothing very difficult or inconvenient that she
could demand; but he had counted too much on the
artificial and too little upon the natural and
primitive woman.
</p>

<p>
Her face still hidden, she felt the full force of
his appeal, but the tempest had its wild will of her.
She believed him guilty; she believed him innocent.
She believed that, if he were guilty, temptation had
come from the woman; she believed that, if he were
innocent, there was nevertheless something&mdash;she did
not know what&mdash;that he was hiding from her.
Faith was ready to destroy much, but would not
jealousy destroy more?  Her jealousy had consumed
dignity, it had ravaged custom, it was burning
restraint.
</p>

<p>
Mary's words had drawn in Marian's mind a concrete
picture, and the contemplation of that picture
had awakened an anger in which her genuine love
had for the first time genuinely expressed itself.
Before, she could have heard with light regret of
Dyker's engagement to marry another woman.
Before, she might herself have drifted with him
through a placid wooing into the port of marriage
that, until this revelation, she had in no wise
understood.  But now she saw things specifically, and in
the element of the specific the quality that she had
known as "womanliness" was dissolved and the
thing that she at last knew to be Woman was
evolved.
</p>

<p>
The issue, she was thus still determined, depended
upon proof of innocence.  He must be clean, and
she must know it.
</p>

<p>
She uncovered her fine face, strangely stronger for
its grief.
</p>

<p>
"Wesley," she said, "I do remember all that you
told me these women and this work would do to
me.  If you prove to be wrong, I shall stay on here,
and, of course, never see you again; but if you prove
to be right I shall give it up, and then, Wesley, I
shall marry you."
</p>

<p>
He rose with a glad cry; but she, rising also,
waved him back.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," she said.  "Either find Mary Morton
and the proofs that she is dishonest&mdash;not only what
I know she is, but dishonest in what she would say
and do&mdash;show me this, or else&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
With straining resolution, he confronted her.
</p>

<p>
"Or else?" he prompted.
</p>

<p>
"Or else bring her to me with her own denial and
explanation."

XXV
<br><br>
DAUGHTERS OF ISHMAEL
</h3>

<p>
When Mary left Rivington Street she faced
the inevitable.  She had seen the impossibility
of domestic service; she knew nothing
of any other trade; she could not endure the
shame of an institution, and her fortune consisted
of just fourteen dollars and fifty cents.
</p>

<p>
She walked, for a long time, aimlessly.  The night
thickened and, block by block, the streets flashed
into electric illumination, each separate flame
glowing like a malevolent eye to show her misery.  Her
strength, never yet fully restored, failed her.  Her
feet were tired, her knees bent irregularly, her head
ached.  As at her first sight of it, the city, which
she knew scarcely better than on that spring evening
when she had been tossed into it, was a conscious
prison implacably shutting her in forever.
</p>

<p>
She walked westward, and then northward.  She
dodged across Fifth Avenue among the automobiles
of careless, comfortable people on their ways to
one place or another of swift enjoyment.  She passed
a notorious café at the warm windows of which she
saw, seated at laden tables and opposite leering men,
the painted faces of softly gowned women, the more
successful examples of what she soon must be.  And
she came to hurrying Broadway through whose
crowds she saw silently and cunningly darting, with
smiling hate written on their tired, rouged lips, the
girls whose dawn was the lighting of the street-lamps
and from whom she wanted to ask for instruction in
the one means of livelihood that remained to her.
</p>

<p>
Her soul was as weakened and vitiated as her
body, and by much the same forces.  Into her escape
from Rose's, into her work at Mrs. Turner's, into
her appeal to the employment-agency and her tasks
at Mrs. Chamberlin's she had put every particle of
strength that she could harness, and the result had
always been failure.  The social system was too
mighty.  She could not prevail against it.  She must
do its bidding, and since it was so impractically
constituted as to bid her prey upon it, her sole solace
must be found in preying fiercely.
</p>

<p>
She turned into a cross-street, full of refulgent
drinking-places that beckoned by swinging doors,
behind which were the voices of singers and through
which passed, in alone and out with shame-faced
men, unending streams of women with white faces
and vermillion mouths and sadly encircled eyes.  But
Mary pressed westward, though she did not clearly
know her intention until, having crossed two avenues,
she found that the cafés gave place to small shops,
and that the shops were giving place to tall, moldy
buildings with long stairways before them, houses
that had once, plainly, made homes, but that were
now, as plainly, barracks for lodgers.
</p>

<p>
From one of these she saw come a slight girl under
a huge hat heavy with two great plumes.  Mary
waited until this girl drew near, first hesitated when
she observed that the girl was scarcely fifteen, then
spoke when she noted the bedizened dress and the
face of which the childish beauty had been trained
to maturity and hardness.
</p>

<p>
"Can you tell me if I can get a room around
here?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
The girl's knowing eyes studied her.
</p>

<p>
"Hello!" she said.  "When did you hit the road?"
</p>

<p>
"To-day.  I want to find a room."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you can't go wrong.  The house I live
in is full-up; but you can ring 'most any bell along
here and get what you want.  There ain't no choice.
One's as bum as another."
</p>

<p>
She nodded saucily and went on her way, and
Mary climbed the steps of the first house she came to.
</p>

<p>
Her ring was answered by a woman that appeared,
as far as Mary could observe in the faint light, to be
about sixty years old.  Her hair was gray and
severely arranged; her dress was shabby, and she
looked very tired.  To Mary she did not seem to be
at all the type that would conduct the sort of place
which the wanderer just then needed.
</p>

<p>
"Can you rent me a room?" she nevertheless inquired.
</p>

<p>
"With privileges?" asked the woman.
</p>

<p>
It was a phrase new to its hearer, but she understood
that it described the kind of room she wanted.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she almost whispered.
</p>

<p>
But the woman did not lower her voice.  Her
descent, as Mary afterwards learned, had been by
slow stages, and her complaisance had been enforced
through a history that began with the establishment
of a respectable boarding-house, when a reform-election
had driven her husband from the police-force,
passed through a widowhood imposed upon by
absconding lodgers and raised house-rents, and ended
by the admission of first one and then many patrons
that were, though they wanted what she had not
always cared to give, at least certain to pay what she
had to turn over to the church-corporation that
owned the property.
</p>

<p>
"I got a nice second-floor front, just a step from
the bath-room, at eighteen dollars," she said.
</p>

<p>
"A month?" inquired Mary.
</p>

<p>
The woman regarded her as if she were somewhat
of a curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not: eighteen a week."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I&mdash;I couldn't afford that."
</p>

<p>
"It's a nice room."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I guess it is, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I might let it to you for fifteen, to start with."
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't afford it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's the parlor.  It's only twelve, an'll
be vacant to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I'll have to get a place for to-night.
Haven't you anything cheaper?"
</p>

<p>
"You don't seem to know nothin' about prices,
miss."  The landlady appeared to reflect.  "But
there's the third-floor back hall-room," she added;
"I can let you have it for seven, an' better than
that you can't do anywheres."
</p>

<p>
Mary hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"You can easy make three times that much," the
woman urged.
</p>

<p>
"Do you&mdash;&mdash;"  Mary wet her dry lips.  "Do you
think so?"
</p>

<p>
"Think so?  Why, the lady that had that room
for a whole year till last week made as high as
twenty dollars a night.  She moved out o' here to
her own flat.  But then, she was good-looking, of
course."
</p>

<p>
Mary had entertained some vague notion of a
small gas-stove, and some saving in the matter of
meals; but this the landlady could in no wise permit.
</p>

<p>
"The insurance sharks won't allow it," she said,
and concluded in a tone that showed the later fact
to be of more importance: "Besides, it so runs up
the gas-bills."
</p>

<p>
Mary said no more.  She paid for a week in
advance, and was shown at once to the cell she had
leased so dearly.
</p>

<p>
It was a little, gaudily-papered room scarcely
fifteen feet long and not much more than two-thirds
that in width.  A stationary washstand was so placed
that the door could not open freely.  At the single
narrow window stood an unsteady table of no apparent
purpose, and along the side a clothes-press
and a narrow, pine bureau.  The bed, however, was
the chief feature of furniture, and that was large
and comfortable.
</p>

<p>
"I'll give you clean sheets every Sunday morning
regular," said the landlady; "but any changes you
want between you'll have to pay for the washin' of."
</p>

<p>
She demanded, and received, twenty-five cents for
a latch-key, added that she permitted no noise in the
rooms, and departed, leaving Mary sitting on the
edge of the bed.
</p>

<p>
The girl's experiences in the house of Rose Légère
had prepared her but imperfectly for this adventure.
It was a new business, and Mary did not know how
to embark upon it.  She was as lost as the chorus-girl,
unused to the purchase of railway tickets and
the engaging of "hotel-accommodations," who finds
herself stranded in a small town.
</p>

<p>
She went to the bureau and looked at herself in
its distorting mirror, in an effort to appraise her
wares.  Her hollow cheeks needed rouge.  Her dull
eyes needed belladonna.  Her clothes were worn.
She felt that she should start work immediately, but
she was afraid.  She went to bed and slept.
</p>

<p>
By the next evening she had spent all but a dollar
and some few cents of the seven dollars and a
quarter that had remained to her.  With her bundles
under her aching arm, she was returning to her
lodging-house to prepare for work, when she stopped
at the "Ladies' Entrance" of the corner-saloon and,
going into a bare apartment for a drink of whiskey,
found, seated at a table, as the only other customer,
the girl of whom she had asked her questions on the
night before.
</p>

<p>
The child smiled as pleasantly as her hardened
face would permit.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, kid," she said.  "How's tricks?"
</p>

<p>
"Hello," replied Mary.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down here," said the girl.
</p>

<p>
Mary accepted her invitation, and gave the
grinning waiter her order.
</p>

<p>
"Got settled?" asked the girl, when the waiter
had come and gone again.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Mary, "I got a room."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"The fifth door from here."
</p>

<p>
The girl whistled.  She was proud of her knowledge.
</p>

<p>
"That old cat Charlotte Michaels!" she commented.
"I bet she stuck you."
</p>

<p>
"She charges me seven dollars a week for a
third-floor back hall-bedroom."
</p>

<p>
"Hell, that's a steal.  Come next door to where
I am, next week.  There'll be a better room there,
then, for a dollar less."
</p>

<p>
Mary looked at the child.  It seemed strange that
she should be about to ask of one perhaps two years
her junior for directions in the ways of the street;
but she saw that the childishness before her was
childishness without innocence, was even lined and
scarred by wisdom.  She wondered about her own
face.
</p>

<p>
"I'm goin' to start out to-night," she said.
</p>

<p>
In the etiquette of this trade the workers ask no
questions of one another and offer few biographies
save those fictitious ones, the threadbare, unimaginative
lies, which they reserve for their inquisitive
purchasers.  Mary's entertainer, therefore, put forward
no inquiries save one:
</p>

<p>
"New in this town?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I'm new in the business," said Mary.
</p>

<p>
The child eyed her doubtingly.
</p>

<p>
"Come off," she good-naturedly replied.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am.  I was in a house onc't, but I'm new
to this, an' I ain't just sure how to go about it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said the child, "it's dead easy to learn
the curves, but it's the hardest job in the world.
Can't your fellow put you wise?"
</p>

<p>
"My fellow?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure, your fellow, your friend, your sweetheart.
Honest, now; ain't you workin' for nobody?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you ought to be.  Most all the girls is.
You can't get along right without one.  Who's goin'
to go your bail when you're pinched?"
</p>

<p>
"Will I be pinched?"
</p>

<p>
"About as often as onc't a month, kid&mdash;unless
you let the cop call onc't a week."
</p>

<p>
"I guess I can stand him," said Mary.  She was
past the stage of objections.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to pay him anyhow, you know."
</p>

<p>
"I thought I might have to."
</p>

<p>
"Then you thought dead right.  Why don't you
get a fellow?  They's lots of them.  They got political
pulls.  Of course, they don't leave you much
money for yourself, but they certainly can fix things
up for you."
</p>

<p>
"Have you a fellow?" asked Mary.
</p>

<p>
"I sure have," said the child, grandly.  "My girl
friend an' I have had one between us ever since we
left school last June."
</p>

<p>
"Does he treat you right?"
</p>

<p>
"As good as any.  He beats us up once in a while
when we don't earn enough, or when he's more than
usual lit up.  But he keeps the cops away, an' he
gets us good trade, an' he's true to the two of us.
He'd ought to be; we make good money for him."
</p>

<p>
Mary listened in a kind of awe.
</p>

<p>
"You like him?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I love him," the child emphatically declared.
"Lots of the girls hates their fellows, but daren't
leave 'em because their fellows'd have 'em pinched
right off&mdash;but I love mine.  You ought to get one.
I'll put you next."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Mary, "I think I'll wait; but I wish
I knew the curves."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hell; it's dead easy, I tell you."  The child
gulped her whiskey and went on: "You just put on
your glad rags at eight o'clock an' walk Broadway
from Twenty-third to Forty-second.  If you can
hustle, you can land half a dozen before one o'clock.
When they give you the glad eye, take it, an' when
they don't, just you walk by 'em sort of hummin'
under your breath.  Stop an' look in the store-windows,
an' they'll come like flies.  But always be sure
to get your money first.  Ask 'em two dollars if they
look that strong, or one if they're cheap guys&mdash;but
don't ever take a cent less'n fifty cents.  I always
gets the two-plunk myself, unless a piker stands out
for a dark corner or hallway and tries the quarter
game: then I go through his clothes for all he's
got."
</p>

<p>
Mary rose, with averted eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's all right," said the child.  "You just
take my tip, an' you'll make good."
</p>

<p>
And, if by managing, by the most detestible sort
of work, to keep clothes upon her back, food in her
stomach and a roof over her head, was making good,
Mary did it.  Everything fell out as the little girl
had described.  That night the adventurer, with no
alternative, sank the last of her scruples, and, when
her room-rent next fell due, she paid it and had a
margin of several dollars to place in her stocking.
</p>

<p>
There was not, she found, very much to be saved,
for the whole world seemed to mark her as
legitimate prey.
</p>

<p>
First, the policemen were quick to see that she was
an unprotected newcomer, and, one by one, to stop
her and threaten her with arrest.  In the beginning,
she was afraid to slip them their tithes, and did it
timidly and awkwardly; but, when she saw how
jauntily and graciously they accepted payment, she
had the bills always ready at the time when they
were expected and, with the bills, the caresses that,
not infrequently, had to accompany them.
</p>

<p>
Other expenses were proportionate.  Rent gained
upon the advance of prosperity.  Showy clothes, if
not the best, were a necessity, and the second-hand
shops raised their prices on the suspicion of her
profession.  Rainy nights came, when there was almost
no business to be done.  The work was of a character
that required sturdy food, and this must be
bought in restaurants tacitly conducted for her class
and charging accordingly.  The men, she soon
discovered, were as loath to buy her a supper as they
were ready to buy her drinks, a condition the sole
consolation of which was the fact that alcohol dulled
whatever remained of the fine edge of sensibility.
</p>

<p>
Some of her cursory Antonies, regarding their
transactions as they regarded their other business
affairs, were honest, but most were honest only when
they had to be, and to them Mary and her kind were
beasts of burden not worthy of the stipulated hire.
There were the lechers that wanted only to waste
the busy minutes in unremunerative talk; there were
the seekers that endeavored to secure through
hideous formulæ of affection what they were too
mean frankly to purchase; there were the hypocritical
male animals that, above suspicion in their daylight
life, considered the women of the night as fair game
for cheating, and then there were the careful toads,
who prided themselves upon their shrewdness, and
who bargained and haggled as a man would be
ashamed to bargain and haggle for a dog.
</p>

<p>
It was a trade of hard hours, hard walking, and
hard drinking, and, in the glaring cafés where she
often sat with her fellow-workers waiting to be
smiled at by the hunters, Mary, though she met many
girls that fared worse than herself, met few that,
when truthful, told of faring better.  The woman
that quitted her landlady's care for "a flat of her
own" represented the ideal toward which this whole
army was hoping, but was an ideal mythical.
</p>

<p>
Nearly all were working in health and out, and
saving nothing.  Nearly all were in bondage to
taskmasters that slunk along after them through the
streets, saw them strike a bargain, waited in the
shadows of a nearby house until the wage was paid,
and then came forward, before the customer had
turned the corner, to exact their tribute.  Born,
through the effects of a wasteful industrial system, in
cellars upon beds of rags, herded as children in attics
where a family of ten slept in a space too small for
five, bred in poverty, always underfed and never
properly protected from the weather, some of them
were used to hardship that no decent social justice
would ever have permitted.  Others had been lured
from comfortable homes.  Still others were the faster
fettered because they had gone from homes too
respectable to allow of any return.  But almost
everyone, through fear of exposure, dread of jail and
reformatory, and awe of their owners' political
influences, was the chattel of a slavery as thorough as that
of which Max Grossman was a minor instrument.
</p>

<p>
The majority of these toilers were ready to receive,
or had long since received, the seeds of tuberculosis;
few could continue their work for five years,
and ninety-five per cent., as a drunken young college
undergraduate one evening cheerfully informed
Mary, were suffering from one or other, and sometimes
from all three, of the trio of diseases common
to their business.  Out from those stuffy bedrooms
and those smoke-clouded, song-filled cafés, men
carried the scourging social illnesses to innocent wives
and to unborn children destined to dwarfed or sightless
lives.  The sufferer might believe himself cured
and bear infection years later.
</p>

<p>
"Now, take yourself, for instance," the lad had
resumed, his cheeks still rosy with youth, but his
eyes aflame with liquor.  "I know something about
these things; but I couldn't tell whether you were
free or not.  You might be sick a long time before
even you could tell, and then you wouldn't risk
starvation by telling about it.  You might be sick right
now for all I know.  But look out for the worst
of all!"
</p>

<p>
Mary heard him with as little heed as she had
heard most men.  She had learned all that he said
from women who knew more of it than, she hoped,
this boy would ever know, and she had been well
assured that it was a danger that no preventive
could wholly defy and no care be certain to
escape.
</p>

<p>
After all, she used to reflect, nothing much
mattered.  She had nothing pleasant to look forward
to and, therefore, she wisely refrained, save for one
advancing idea, from looking forward.  She had
no past that did not have its pain for her vision, and,
therefore, with this sole exception, she resolutely
kept her eyes upon the present day.
</p>

<p>
Yet gradually one great passion was growing
within her.  That process of thought which had
begun in her encounter with Philip Beekman, when
she left his mother's employment, had been hastened
in its growth by what Marian Lennox had said and
failed to do, and the shock of the girl's embarkation
upon her new profession had only momentarily
retarded it.  She was not large enough&mdash;few of us
are&mdash;to see the conditions behind the individual, nor
yet greatly to concern herself with individuals that
did not directly concern her; but she saw clearly her
own plight, and now saw, or thought she saw, that
this plight was due entirely to the machinations of
the man who had taken her from her home and
brought her to New York.  She could have loved
him, and so she hated him; she could still feel a
tenderness for what he might have been, so she
permitted herself to feel only animosity for what he
had proved himself to be.  To him she traced
directly all that had befallen her, and as she could
not go beyond him, so from him, she slowly and
finally resolved, she would exact payment.  That
thought waxed in her tired mind; it was fed with
every throe of her pained body until it dominated
her circumscribed outlook upon the world.  It even
saved her from suffering, because it so possessed her
that it armored her against all lesser things.  She
had found, at last, a purpose in life.
</p>

<p>
It was almost coincident with her realization of
this that Mary realized something else.  She went
immediately to a physician.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Helwig, a man with an enormous paunch and
a round face and triple chin, was one of the many
excellent practitioners that depend for their
living&mdash;and it is a good one&mdash;upon the class to which
Mary belonged.  He treated the matter for what
it was: a commonplace in his day's work.  At the
end of a week he confirmed her fears.
</p>

<p>
For a moment she reeled under the blow.  The
bookcases with their ponderous volumes in dark
bindings, the shelves burdened with phials, the glass
medicine-case, the convertible table for minor
operations, the crowded desk, and even the fat physician
before it, seemed to whirl in a mad saraband.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come!" she heard the doctor say, as he
thrust an uncorked bottle of smelling-salts under her
nose.
</p>

<p>
"How long will it last?" she panted.
</p>

<p>
"We must keep up our treatment for six months
or a year," he answered.  "Meantime, diet and
quiet.  No liquor.  If you were a millionaire, I'd
prescribe a long sea-voyage or a trip to Hot
Springs."
</p>

<p>
Out of the chaos of her brain a sudden idea was
shaping.
</p>

<p>
"What," she inquired, "about other people catching
this?"
</p>

<p>
He knew her business perfectly, and he knew that
what he had to say on this point would weigh but
little in the scale against want.  Nevertheless, he
made the common answer.
</p>

<p>
After that she listened to all the instructions that
he gave her.  More than ever now she had her purpose
in life.

XXVI
<br><br>
"THE LEAST OF THESE"
</h3>

<p>
A week later, in a lamp-lighted street, Mary
and Carrie met.  Each girl was too conscious
of her own business to remark that it was
the business of her acquaintance, and each tried to
avoid the other; but before recognition was complete
they were face to face.  Silence was confession.
Mary spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Hello," she said, "it's a long time since I seen
you.  How are you, anyways?"
</p>

<p>
Carrie, though still a homely girl, wore a
close-fitting coat that made the best of her figure.  Her
hat was wide and new and, as she answered, she
turned from the light.
</p>

<p>
"Pretty well," she said, and paused short.
</p>

<p>
"I guess," said Mary, "you thought it was queer,
my never comin' to see you; but I haven't had a
single chance.  I'll come soon, honest I will.  How's
Katie?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," Carrie slowly answered, "I'm
not living with her any more."
</p>

<p>
"You ain't?  Since when ain't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know&mdash;a couple of weeks."
</p>

<p>
"You two didn't scrap?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I had to go away."  And then, to divert
the fire, Carrie added: "Are you still working at
that place the Settlement-people got for you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I left that long ago.  Have you gone back
to the shirtwaist-factory?"
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't: the strike was never settled, and,
anyhow, they wouldn't have taken me back if I'd been
willing to go."
</p>

<p>
Mary looked at the long coat and the gray hat.
</p>

<p>
"But, say," she began, "you don't look&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her eyes dropped to Carrie's and, suddenly, she
knew.  Her voice softened.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," she said.  "I had to do it, too."
</p>

<p>
Silently they touched hands.  The Lithuanian's
breast rose and fell quickly.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't do anything else," said Carrie, but only
in explanation, not in extenuation or excuse.  "There
was no other work I could do."
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Mary.
</p>

<p>
"And everywhere I went," continued Carrie, "he
followed me.  He was always just behind me when
I walked, always just around the corner when I stood
still.  When I was dizzy and hungry, he always
looked well fed and always had the money in his
hand.  He waited, waited, waited."
</p>

<p>
"You mean your fellow?" Mary asked.
</p>

<p>
Carrie assented.  "If you can call him that," she
said.  "He has two or three others working for him,
or he'd be across the street now.  I'm different from
them&mdash;freer.  I'm not afraid of him, and so he is
a little afraid of me."
</p>

<p>
Mary took the girl's arm.
</p>

<p>
"They won't let us stop this way on the pavement,"
she said.  "Come in here and have a drink."
</p>

<p>
They went into the women's room of one of the
quieter saloons.  Mary, mindful of the doctor's
directions, took only carbonated water, but Carrie ordered
whiskey.
</p>

<p>
Mary, with her stomach crying out for the alcohol,
and, in that wrenching desire, nearly seizing her
companion's liquor, sipped the water.
</p>

<p>
"I've quit it," she averred.  "It don't pay."
</p>

<p>
"Most of the men make you take it," said Carrie.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Mary admitted, "but you can chuck it
on the floor if you're fly."  She took another sip of
the water, and then asked: "Why don't you shake
this man if you're not scared of him.  You can come
with me, you know."
</p>

<p>
"It wouldn't be good business," Carrie declared.
"I need somebody with influence to look after me
in case I'm arrested."
</p>

<p>
Mary was silent for a minute, thinking.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you're right," she granted; "there's
one of 'em I'd like to find."
</p>

<p>
"Who is it?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you sometime.&mdash;Look here: I don't feel
like workin' Broadway to-night, an' I've got some
money.  Let's do a dance-hall."
</p>

<p>
They "did" several.  At the first a mask-ball was
in progress; the bachanalian guests had rented
extravagant costumes; confetti was tossed by the
onlookers, and swiftly shifting lights of red and blue,
of green and purple, played upon the dancers, whose
whirling shadows, monstrously magnified, were
thrown upon sheeted walls.  At another, there was
an explosion of obscene epithets followed by a fight,
which made retreat advisable; and at a third, the
dances were so short and the intervals provided for
the solicitations of the waiters were so long that both
girls wearied of the scene.
</p>

<p>
On Tenth Avenue they at last found, however, a
place more to their liking.  It was the usual type of
room, enlarged by tearing out the thin partitions
that had once divided it into several tenements.  The
lights shone sick through the clouding smoke, and
the air was heavy with the odors of dust, tobacco,
alcohol, and sweat.  But the music was lively, the
floor crowded, and the little tables along the walls
were surrounded by laughing groups of drinking
men and women.  Of the former, though most were
hollow-chested, pale-cheeked, hawk-nosed, some
showed clearly that they came to plunder; and if the
majority of the latter were gum-chewing working-girls
still in their earliest teens, many were of the
variety to which the two newcomers now belonged.
</p>

<p>
Mary and her companion sat down at a table
near the door.  They nodded to the burly,
cigar-smoking "Boss," who moved energetically about,
urging bloodless lads to find partners, and now and
then himself taking a turn with a neglected girl.
They exchanged familiar greetings, though they had
never before seen her, with the false-jeweled woman
whose business it was to assist the boss in stimulating
the dancers by precept and example.  And they
watched the scene with a gaze grave and calculating.
</p>

<p>
Here a child of thirteen, with closed eyes and her
peach-tinted cheek against her pimpled partner's,
undulated to the music, scarcely moving her feet.
Nearby there whirled, like a dervish, a girl to whose
consumptive face the revolutions brought a glow
that mimicked health.  Now and then a woman
would leap from one of the tables, embrace an
unembarrassed man about the neck and so waltz off
with him, at once passionate and mocking, both of
them deaf to the plaudits of their spectators.  From
time to time the lights were suddenly extinguished,
and the dance went on in the darkness amid a chorus
of kisses, cries, and giggling.  Most of the boys and
men, and nearly all of the little girls, were drunk.
</p>

<p>
Among the dancers, doubtless plying his trade,
Mary saw Rafael Angelelli, sleek and radiant in a
new suit of pale buff.  He detected her a little later
and, disposing of a pure-faced child, who had been
in his arms, made a skillful way to his old acquaintance.
He shook Mary's reluctant hand and, nodding
to Carrie as if she were a familiar friend, sat
down between the two women.
</p>

<p>
"Where you been?" he affably inquired of Mary.
</p>

<p>
"Out of town," said Mary, coldly.
</p>

<p>
Angel shrugged his shoulders.  He knew she lied,
but he rarely contradicted a lady.
</p>

<p>
"Meester Dyk' been lookin' all over theesa town
for you, Violet," he said.
</p>

<p>
Mary did not like the news.  She was still afraid
that she might be wanted in connection with her
contradictory affidavits.
</p>

<p>
Angel, however, readily reassured her.  Just what
Dyker wanted he did not, he said, know; but he was
certain that it was something for her benefit.  The
magistrate had commissioned him to find her, and
Angel had been searching, sporadically, for several
weeks, even tracing her course back to the
employment-agency and to that Mrs. Turner's where she
had first worked.
</p>

<p>
"Theesa woman say you steal," said the Italian.
</p>

<p>
"She's a liar," answered Mary, hotly.
</p>

<p>
"She say she tol' you so."
</p>

<p>
"She tried to make out I took a cake of soap."
</p>

<p>
"But she say after you leave she meess two dollar
an' some silka stockin'."
</p>

<p>
"That woman never wore no silk stockin's in her
life, an' there wasn't two dollars in the house."
</p>

<p>
Again the Italian shrugged his shoulders.  He
gave Mary to understand that, in his opinion, any
woman who could steal and did not was a fool, and
that any woman who stole and acknowledged it was
a worse fool.  But what, plainly, most interested him
was the execution of his commission from Dyker.
He talked so earnestly about it that he failed entirely
to lay Mary's fears.  She refused to give him her
address, and as soon as he had left the table she
endeavored to quit the hall.
</p>

<p>
The entrance of an acquaintance detained her.
There were words that had to be said and drinks
that had to be bought.  Half an hour passed, and
then, as she started with Carrie for the door, Mary
saw Wesley Dyker standing outside.  He was
wrapped in a heavy overcoat with its military collar
turned up about his chin and his black derby pulled
far over his eyes; but Mary feared him too much
to fail of recognition.
</p>

<p>
"There he is!" she whispered, catching her
companion's arm.  "The Dago telephoned him.  I was
afraid of that."
</p>

<p>
Escape was hopeless.  She sent Carrie back to
the dancers, and, going out, met Dyker, her head
erect.
</p>

<p>
"I heard you was lookin' for me," she said.
</p>

<p>
Wesley raised his hat.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said dryly; "walk a block or two with me."
</p>

<p>
They went for some time in silence, Mary too
much upon the defensive to risk beginning a
conversation, and Dyker trying in vain to command the
anger that had been growing with every day since
he had learned how she had betrayed him to Marian.
At the first dark street into which he turned her,
his resentment burst its guard.
</p>

<p>
"What in hell do you mean by telling everybody
all you know about me?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
Mary shrank away.
</p>

<p>
"No, you don't!" he said, and seized her hand.
"Didn't I do you the best turn that was ever done
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," the woman quavered.  "An' I wouldn't
pay you back the way you say I done.  I never talked
about you to nobody."
</p>

<p>
"Don't lie.  You know you did."
</p>

<p>
Mary remembered, but she shook her head determinedly.
</p>

<p>
"I've never once spoke your name," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you to stop lying!" rejoined Dyker.
"You told it once at the Settlement on Rivington
Street.  I know it.  I learned it there myself."
</p>

<p>
"What did I tell?" asked Mary.  Her tone was
defiant, but her endeavor was to draw his fire.
</p>

<p>
They walked forward.
</p>

<p>
"You said I hung out at Rose's," he protested.
"You said I was her lover and yours."
</p>

<p>
"I never said I had nothing to do with you,
Mr. Dyker.  I don't care who told you I did; I never
said no such thing."
</p>

<p>
"You said I went to Rose's.  I know you did."
</p>

<p>
She confessed to that, for she was truly sorry for it.
</p>

<p>
"But I didn't mean to, Mr. Dyker," she added;
"honest, I didn't.  It just slipped out.  I didn't
know Miss Marian knowed you.  Why, she told
me she didn't know you, an' how'd I ever think she'd
lie?"
</p>

<p>
That was a question which, ignorant of Miss
Lennox's precise method of evasion, Wesley did not,
even to himself, attempt to answer.
</p>

<p>
"It didn't matter whether she knew me or not,"
he said; "you had no right to tell it."
</p>

<p>
"I know that.  It just slipped out.  But it won't
never happen again.  I wasn't so wise as I am now."
</p>

<p>
"I hope not," he said, a trifle mollified by the
sincerity in her tone.  "But you've done me a big
amount of harm there, Violet, and you have got to
undo it."
</p>

<p>
Her first sensation had been one of relief in finding
that her false affidavit was not held against her;
her next had been fright at his anger; but now she
was all penitence for the ill she had wrought him.
Dyker was the one man in New York that had done
her a kindness, and she held that kindness as the
greatest possible.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" she asked.  "I'd do most
anything for you, Mr. Dyker: you know that."
</p>

<p>
They were under the uncertain light of a crossing.
He eyed her narrowly, mistrustingly.
</p>

<p>
"I want you," he replied, "to come to my office
to-morrow evening at six.  Here's my card.  Will
you do it?"
</p>

<p>
She took the card and thrust it through the opening
of her shirtwaist.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want with me when you get me
there?" she wondered.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to come with me to Miss Lennox,
and deny the story that you told her about me."
</p>

<p>
Mary's heart sank.  She could not bear the
thought of facing Marian.
</p>

<p>
"What's the use o' that?" she pleaded.
</p>

<p>
"What's the use?  Why, how else are you going
to put me right with her?"
</p>

<p>
"But I couldn't."
</p>

<p>
"You must."
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't, Mr. Dyker.  Honest, I couldn't.
She'd know I was lyin' to her."
</p>

<p>
"You leave that to me."
</p>

<p>
"What excuse'd I give her?"
</p>

<p>
"We'll fix that up to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Please don't make me do it, Mr. Dyker!"
</p>

<p>
"I've got to.  What else can I do?&mdash;It's all your
own fault.  What's your address?"
</p>

<p>
She gave it to him tremulously.
</p>

<p>
"All right," he said.  "I'll have a cab there for
you to-morrow at five-thirty."
</p>

<p>
Her body shook with frightened sobs.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Dyker," she repeated, "please don't
make me do this!  I'd do anythin', 'most, under the
sun for you; but I can't face Miss Marian&mdash;honest
to God, I can't."
</p>

<p>
What he should have done was to play upon her
gratitude, but what he did do was again to allow his
mistrust and anger to have their rein.
</p>

<p>
"I won't have any nonsense about this, Violet,"
he said.  "If you don't come to my office to-morrow
at six, I'll have you arrested&mdash;and I'll see to it that
you won't escape with a mere fine, either."
</p>

<p>
"It won't&mdash;&mdash;"  She could not grasp it.  "What
do you mean?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I mean I'll have you arrested on a big charge."
</p>

<p>
Her lips stiffened with that common terror of the
law, about the only terror that the law ever succeeds
nowadays in creating: the unreasoning terror that
seldom serves as a deterrent.
</p>

<p>
"I ain't done nothin' but this," she said, in the
full knowledge that what she had or had not done
would be no factor in the problem.
</p>

<p>
"You'll find out about that when the time comes,"
he answered.  "What I want to know is whether
you'll do me this favor or not."
</p>

<p>
He had stopped and confronted her.  Even in the
semi-darkness her anxious eyes managed to read his
pale, determined face, but even in the daylight they
could have found there no relenting.
</p>

<p>
She gave him a despairing smile.
</p>

<p>
"I guess I've got to," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you'll have to."
</p>

<p>
"All right."
</p>

<p>
"You'll do it?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll do it, all right."
</p>

<p>
"No bluff?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Remember: if you don't, I'll fix you."
</p>

<p>
Mary turned away.
</p>

<p>
"I'll not forget," she said.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't," he called after her, "you won't
be sorry."
</p>

<p>
"I won't forget," she repeated.
</p>

<p>
And yet, even as she walked away from him, the
sickness of indecision was upon her.  Like all narrow
experiences, her narrow experience made her afraid
of everything beyond its own limits.  Her habit of
life was the habit of the weakened bird of prey that
attacks only the defenseless and flies before the
strong.  She had become a moral coward, and the
progress of her physical disease directly accentuated
the insidious encroachments of her moral illness.  She
could not openly face Marian; she did not dare
openly to defy Dyker.  She wanted only to run away.
</p>

<p>
By four o'clock the next afternoon she had run
away.  The night had been a wearisome journey
backward and forward between the decision to obey
the magistrate and the decision to evade him.  She
thought that she owed him much, but she knew that
she could not successfully face Marian and lie.  She
was tremblingly afraid of Wesley's vengeance, but
she was more afraid of Marian's honest eyes.  All
day she lay upon her bed, dizzy from this circling
process of thought, but at last, in an attack of dread
of the lie more severe than any that had preceded
it, she flung her clothes into a little trunk, which she
had recently purchased, and, calling a cab, drove to a
new lodging-house.
</p>

<p>
She did not go out that evening, but the next she
had to go, and she had not been on Broadway for
two hours before a plain-clothes man touched her arm.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, kid," he said, "but you've got to
come along with me."
</p>

<p>
Instinctively she recoiled, but the detective's
fingers had slipped to her wrist and tightened on it.
The sword had fallen.
</p>

<p>
"Where to?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
She knew the man.  She had given him money,
and more than money, yet she expected no mercy,
expected nothing but an explanation.
</p>

<p>
"Jefferson Market," said her captor.  "But if
you've got anybody handy who'll go your bail, I'll
take you to see him first, before we go down to
Ninth Street."
</p>

<p>
Mary shook her head.  Helpless horror had her
for its own.
</p>

<p>
"No use," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Certain sure," she said, and then, a little wistfully:
"I guess there ain't no good in tryin' to talk
business to you?"
</p>

<p>
The detective was a big, black-mustached man.
His face was not unkindly, but he was helpless.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said; "this here's orders from the
front.  If you haven't got some fellow to be ready
with bail, I guess we'd better hurry up."
</p>

<p>
They crossed to Sixth Avenue and walked down
that noisy thoroughfare to the towering brick fortress
that stands like a castle to guard the gateway
of old Greenwich Village.
</p>

<p>
By day that somber building seems to hide behind
the grim planks of the elevated railroad; it is ugly,
neglected, innocent; under its protecting wings are
the stalls of white-aproned butchers and the open
establishments of green-grocers and hucksters plying
their several occupations.  But no sooner does the
darkness drop its curtain over the webbed streets, the
dirty courts, and the foul alleys that surround the
place, than Jefferson Market ceases to be a building
for the dispensation of food and becomes a court
for the dispensation of the commodity that we
carelessly label Justice.  The hands of the large clock
in the high tower are hurried toward the hour of
twelve; long rays of sinister light are shot from
windows narrow and barred; and under a vaulted
entrance-way there pours, from year's end to year's
end, an unending army of those women of the street
who have lost, for one reason or another, their ability
any longer to purchase the protection of the Law.
</p>

<p>
It is not often that what the statutes designate as
crime comes to the Night Court: Crime may wait for
the morning.  It is the drunkard, the vagrant, the
licenseless pedlar, and, above all, unfriended Maria
Peripatetica, the human being that humanity has
spoiled in the making, who is taken there.  Above
all, the Marias Peripateticæ that have, once fostered
by the Law, quarreled with it, failed to bribe it, or
openly rebelled against it.  Black and white,
short-skirted and gray-haired, besilked and bedraggled,
from nine in the evening until early morning, five
thousand in a twelvemonth, they are brought to the
Jefferson Market Court for judgment from the
power that has made them what they are.
</p>

<p>
And judgment is what they receive.  The law is
a mill that was made to grind out one thing, and
can grind no other; the courts were constituted to
make criminals and to punish them, not to prevent
or to cure; our present justice is not mercy; it is
formulæ, not sentiment.  There is one woman that
has some small authority in this tribunal, one woman
that sees an occasional girl with some promise in
her face and takes her away to Waverley House for
observation and to be given, if all goes well, a chance
at other employment; but Waverley House is small,
it is poor, and there is small chance for her that has
been twice stricken.  One woman cannot do much
against the grinding mill, and the grinding mill,
between January and December, sends only seventeen
girls to a semi-sane reformatory as compared to
three thousand that it sends to the university of
crime which is known as "The Island."
</p>

<p>
Mary was hurried up a short flight of stone steps
and into a small hallway.  A metal gate was opened
for her and snapped shut as she passed it.  A stocky
man took her name and address and got, from her
conductor, in a voice that she could not hear, the
charge on which she had been arrested, and then,
after one turn to the left and another to the right,
she was shoved through a door and into a
brightly-lighted, heavily-barred detention-pen.
</p>

<p>
Dazedly, she looked about.  Beside her, upon one
side, sat a gray-haired woman of sixty, too old any
longer to earn that tribute which would have secured
her immunity for the prosecution of the trade she
must recently have adopted.  Nearby was a girl of
thirteen, who, temporarily neglected by her owner,
had been arrested for the same offense.  On the
bench sat a fat negress who informed all listeners
that she was falsely charged with picking the pocket
of a bald-headed white man that she had solicited.
Over them all streamed the pitiless light of strong
lamps, upon them all were soon to feast the eyes of
the crowd in the near court-room.
</p>

<p>
The newcomer bowed her head.  She did not
know that a court-retainer had been waiting her
arrival.  She did not know that, as soon as she had
entered, this retainer had hurried to a telephone.
She did not know that, in answer to this call, Rafael
Angelelli had hurried to the door that she had just
passed, and there presented a note bearing a potent
signature.  She did not even know that these things
were of common enough occurrence, and she was
aware of only her misery until she heard the Italian's
low voice and saw him beckoning her to the bars.
</p>

<p>
She almost ran toward him.  The other prisoners
gathered about her, but the officer that accompanied
Angel waved them away, and himself drew back.
Mary clutched the bars as if they had been a tangible
hope.
</p>

<p>
"Angel!" she whispered.
</p>

<p>
But Angelelli fronted her, scowling.  He shook
a tight fist under her shrinking eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You are a dam' fool!" he answered.
</p>

<p>
Mary could not articulate.  Her lips involuntarily
found an unthought query, but her voice was dumb.
</p>

<p>
"Why you not leesten to theesa Wesley Dyk'?"
pursued Rafael.  "Now maybe you go to the Island.
You know what that mean?  Theesa jailers cut off
your hair, beat you up every mornin', every evenin'
regular.  No meals; only bread an' water; no wheeskey.
An' when you come out every cop hava you'
peecture an' you get arrest' each time an' senta back
again to jail!"
</p>

<p>
She believed him.  She would have believed
anything that was said to her by someone she had
previously known.  With a flow of ready tears that
blinded her sunken eyes, she begged him to tell her
of some way of escape.
</p>

<p>
Angel was ready with his answer.  It seemed that
he still represented Wesley Dyker and that Mr. Dyker
was not disposed to be so hard on her as impartial
justice demanded that he should be.  In the
back-room of a nearby saloon there were a lawyer
and a notary in waiting.  If Mary would promise
to swear to and sign before them a prepared paper
denying the accusations she had made to Marian,
Angel would now, by means of a second note, see
that the sitting magistrate did but fine her, and
would hand her at once the amount of that fine.
</p>

<p>
She had supposed that her arrest had been on the
charge of larceny from Mrs. Turner's boarding-house;
she had not known that she was accused of
no more than the practice of her trade, and she could
scarcely credit news so good as this which Angel
brought her.
</p>

<p>
"An' I won't have to go to Miss Marian?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"No.  Meest' Dyk' want thees paper for hees
girl&mdash;jus' to square heemself witha hees girl&mdash;no
more.  You go where you want."
</p>

<p>
"An' the judge'll let me off?"
</p>

<p>
"Right away."
</p>

<p>
She promised, and a moment later was led into
the court-room.
</p>

<p>
She saw the gaping, leering crowd, which filled
half of that apartment beyond the low grating.  She
saw the stolid policemen herding their charges as
stockyard hands herd cattle for the slaughter.  She
saw the stealthy slavers buzzing in and out, bent
upon nefarious rescue; the waiting lawyers on the
outer bench and the laughing lawyers inside, joking
together or making mirth before the desk at which,
in his black robe, sat the weary, cynical, indifferent
magistrate, his face as expressionless as that of a
Chinese Joss.  She heard, between the roars of
elevated trains, the unintelligible oaths, administered,
as she now understood that the average oath is
administered, with a rapidity that robbed them of all
dignity and most effect; the drone of testimony
constantly interrupted to the point of confusion and
always curtailed to the exclusion of essential truth;
the mechanical pronouncement of sentence that ended,
as if the two things were on phrase, in the summoning
of the succeeding case.  All this she saw and heard
and disregarded.  She had been struck down, trapped,
held fast in the grip of the invisible enemy that she
thought of as the City.  She had been conscious of
nothing but the living Fear, and now, Angel had told
her, some portion of relief was at hand.
</p>

<p>
Her arraignment, the payment of her fine, her
meeting with the waiting Italian, her progress to
the nearby saloon where the lawyer and the notary
were ready for her&mdash;all this passed like a vision of
the night.  She signed without reading it&mdash;though
she would not have understood it if she had read
it&mdash;the formal denial to which her affirmation was
immediately affixed.  She was too dazed to think
until, leaving the three smiling men behind her, she
had turned again into free Sixth Avenue.
</p>

<p>
It was then that she saw coming toward her a
young man&mdash;a young man that might have been
anywhere from nineteen to thirty-two&mdash;with hair that
was dark and curly, sorely-shaven olive cheeks just
showing the defeated tokens of a blue-black beard;
a dapper, prosperous young man, with thick lips and
hard eyes and a smartly cut overcoat, from one pocket
of which flashed a brilliant-bordered handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
In the instant Mary's exhaustion dropped from
her brain and shoulders.  She forgot her fright of
the earlier evening; she remembered only the
sufferings from which it had arisen.  Her waiting had
not, after all, been vain.  She was calm, she was
resourceful, she was resolved.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Max," she said.
</p>

XXVII
<br><br>
JUDGMENT
</h3>

<p>
At first he did not know her.  He stood there,
while their eyes were locked, in his own eyes
no gleam of honest memory.  He was
unchanged&mdash;the serene, the secure, the smug Max
Grossman of that first meeting in the street of her
little Pennsylvania town; but she, as she so well
knew without this silent testimony, was not now, and
never again could be, the girl of that lost springtime.
He looked at her, his thick lips drawn thin
in a professional grimace, and not until she spoke
a second time did he recognize her.
</p>

<p>
He started then, and his olive face went pale; but
Mary put out her hand precisely as if she were meeting,
after a brief absence, only an acquaintance of
the everyday friendly sort, and Max, too glad for
pardon to question motive, seized and squeezed her
hand tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"Vhat?" he cried in mock pleasure at this <i>contretemps</i>.
"No, it <i>ain'd</i>!  I gan't hardly belief mine
eyes you're lookin' so fine.  But it <i>is</i> Mary Denbigh!"
</p>

<p>
She smiled almost gayly.  In little she had to lie,
but in much, though for a reason that he must not
suspect, she was indeed exultant.
</p>

<p>
"I am lookin' good, ain't I, Max?" she said.
</p>

<p>
He surveyed her cheap finery; saw her hair,
disordered in her passage through the crowded
court-room, and turned his gaze quickly from her hollow,
painted cheeks, her hardening carmine mouth, and
her heavily ringed eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You're <i>grand</i>," he said.  "I always knew you'd
make good, Mary."
</p>

<p>
"You jollier!" she laughed, and with her free
hand, patted his olive cheek.
</p>

<p>
"No, it's <i>hon</i>est, so help me."
</p>

<p>
"Then don't you want to buy me a drink, Max?"
</p>

<p>
Grossman dropped her hand.  His face grew
doubtful.
</p>

<p>
"I vish I had <i>dime</i>," he said, "but I god to see
a friend down the Avenue, an'&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A lady, Max?"
</p>

<p>
"Ach, no, Mary."
</p>

<p>
"Then let him go.  You ought to be glad to take
a walk with as good-lookin' a girl as you say I am."
</p>

<p>
For another fleeting instant Max let his eyes rest
on her face, then lowered them.  He looked at the
pavement and drew an awkward line upon it with
the edge of his tan boot-sole.  More significant than
any physical change in her was the fact that she could
now embarrass him.
</p>

<p>
"I know, Mary," he stammered; "but, you see,
this here feller vhat I tol'&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She laughed again.  She thrust her arm through
his and turned his face uptown.
</p>

<p>
"Forget it!" she said.  "Don't you worry, Max;
I ain't goin' to rake things up, if that's what's
souring you.  Life's too short.  All I want is a talk and
a drink."
</p>

<p>
Half reluctantly, he let her lead him; but she
could lead him and that sufficed her.
</p>

<p>
He lit an American cigarette and puffed it nervously.
</p>

<p>
"I've just been in there," she said, with a backward
jerk of her head in the direction of the police-court.
</p>

<p>
"There?"  Max was not surprised, but he added:
"Vhat vas you doin' in there?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you think?" responded Mary.  She
herself was thinking rapidly&mdash;about other things.
</p>

<p>
"You vasn't in drouble?"
</p>

<p>
"I guess you would call it that."
</p>

<p>
"Pinched?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
He had asked her no questions about her
past&mdash;but concerning her present he chanced a
query.
</p>

<p>
"Mary," he inquired, "do you mean they god
you up fer your beesiness?"
</p>

<p>
"That's about it," she said.
</p>

<p>
"But vhy don't you square you'self vith the goppers?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  I&mdash;I was broke, Max."
</p>

<p>
"I vish I gould <i>help</i> you, Mary," he said, his
curiosity cooling at the thought of an appeal for
assistance.
</p>

<p>
She saw it, and it amused her.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you do it?" she asked, dropping her voice
into a whine.
</p>

<p>
He tried to draw away from her, but her linked
arm held him affectionately fast.
</p>

<p>
"I been havin' rotten luck," he declared; "somethin'
awful.  I ain't got hardly only the money vhat's
in my <i>glothes</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then," said Mary, looking at the clothes
and knowing well that they somewhere concealed an
ample yellow sum, "why don't you take me on your
staff?"
</p>

<p>
"Mary," he cried, trying to spread his hands, and
failing dismally with the one that her pinioning arm
hampered, "vhat do you think I am?  A millionaire?
I ain't got no staff."
</p>

<p>
"Come off!" she bantered.
</p>

<p>
"I ain't&mdash;honest."
</p>

<p>
"Still in the other line?" she persisted.  "I
thought you might be trottin' 'em on the street&mdash;they
say there's more in it.  Why do you stick to
supplyin' the flats and the houses?"
</p>

<p>
Her voice was the perfection of good nature, but
he writhed under it.
</p>

<p>
"Mary!" he pleaded.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she said, disregarding his tone, and
keeping his arm fast in her own, "you do supply 'em,
don't you?  I know one fellow who makes his livin'
goin' the rounds, findin' what girls is sore on their
madams an' then gettin' a commission by sneakin'
'em out an' changin' 'em to new flats.  He lets on
he's sellin' kimonas, but one sample's lasted him three
years."
</p>

<p>
"Mary!" repeated Max, more weakly.
</p>

<p>
"That's the truth," she said, and then: "But
can't you start street-work an' take me on your
staff?"
</p>

<p>
Again he looked at her,
</p>

<p>
"No," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"Not young enough lookin' now, eh?"  She was
still smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Ach," he protested, "you oughtn't nod to be
so <i>hard</i> on a feller.  If you chust knowed&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But she had gone far enough, and she would not
let him finish.  They had reached a saloon near to
her new lodging-place, and she paused.  There was,
and she knew it, no word in his excuse that she would
have credited.  Nor did she mean, just yet, to let
him see her hatred.  In order that he might the
better see it at a later moment, she wanted now to
quiet his naturally ready fears.  She had found that
she could harass him, and that, for the present, was
all that she needed to know.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," she said, "I told you I wasn't
goin' to rake up nothin', an' I mean to keep my word.
Come on in here.  This is a quiet place.  You're
goin' to buy me a drink, anyhow, just to show that
we're still friends."
</p>

<p>
He brightened at this indicated avenue of escape.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sure</i> we're still friends," he declared, "an' you
can haf all you vant to <i>drink</i>, too."
</p>

<p>
She slipped her hand into his&mdash;she could do it,
she had learned, without the dumb flesh seeming to
shrink from that contact&mdash;and pressed it.
</p>

<p>
They went into the deserted "ladies' room" of
the saloon to which she had referred, and sat down
there, facing each other under a light turned kindly
low.
</p>

<p>
"Vhiskey?" asked Max.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mary.
</p>

<p>
"Two of 'em," ordered Max of the waiter
that had answered his ring, "an' don'd make
'em so <i>stingy</i> like most you fellers ofer this
vay."
</p>

<p>
The man brought the liquor, placed it before
them, and went away.
</p>

<p>
"Vell," said Max, raising his glass, smiling his
thin smile, and apparently forgetting that he had
ever denied whiskey; "here ve are, <i>ain't</i> it?"
</p>

<p>
If Mary was remembering another night and another
drink she did not say so; instead, as Max tilted
his sleek head far back between his shoulders and
dropped the whiskey down his throat, her hand
watched for the instant when his gray eyes were on
the ceiling and that instant poured the liquor from
her own glass to the floor.  When her companion's
head came forward her fingers, wrapped about the
glass, were just withdrawing it from her lips.
</p>

<p>
"I can drink that better'n I used to," she said.
</p>

<p>
Max grinned again.  So long as she did not upbraid
him for his part in it, so long as she did not
go into the details of its earlier stages, he had no
objection to hearing of her past, was even languidly
curious about it, and was certainly sorry that it had
not brought her to more seeming prosperity.
</p>

<p>
"You sure didn't take that like you vasn't <i>used</i>
vith it," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take another just to show you how," she
answered, and pressed the nearest button.
</p>

<p>
This time his eyes were on her and she had to
drink.  But she did not scruple: so long as she
retained her head and Max lost his, the effect
of the alcohol on her system concerned her but
little.
</p>

<p>
They had a third drink, for "old time's sake," as
Mary suggested, and this she succeeded in pouring
down her dress-front.  At the fourth, Max began
to show signs of fear that he would have a drunken
woman on his hands, but Mary's patent sobriety soon
reassured him, and overcame his protests against a
fifth by recalling his promise of liberality.
</p>

<p>
His cold eyes sparkled into a faint light.  Little
spots of red appeared in the olive of his cheeks.  He
felt the advance of the enemy in his veins and tried
to go; but Mary began an imaginative narrative of
her recent experiences and insisted on his listening.
When he at last successfully interrupted that, she
twitted him with being able to drink less than his
pupils, and Max was once more forced to order.
He was not drunk, or nearly drunk, but the fine
edge of his discretion was dulled: he saw in the
woman, who had now moved to his side, nothing
that, whatever motives might be at work, could
possibly harm him; he found something ludicrous in
the situation.  Her looks seemed better than they
had appeared an hour earlier, and her tentative
advances flattered him.
</p>

<p>
Mary, though she had drunk more than was good
for her, had managed to spill enough liquor to retain
all the sobriety she needed; but, when they at last
rose, she swayed a little unsteadily.
</p>

<p>
"Now," she said, "you'll just buy me a half-pint
for my head in the mornin', an' then you'll walk as
far as my door."
</p>

<p>
Still enjoying the piquancy of the affair, he obeyed
her.  He even consented to come to her hall-bedroom
with her&mdash;a room the exact reproduction of that
which she had formerly rented farther uptown&mdash;and
there, forgetful of the provision against the morning,
they finished the half-pint.
</p>

<p>
At last he stood up from the bed on which he had
been sitting while she, opposite, used the single chair.
</p>

<p>
"Vell," he said, grinning; "it's been good to see
you again, und maybe I'll gome back some efenin'."
</p>

<p>
She rose before him.  The light was at her back
and her face resumed, as she stood there, some furtive
traces of its earlier grace.  The eyes seemed to
soften, the cheeks were a natural pink beneath their
coating of rouge, and her russet hair, curling about
her face, relieved the harder outlines and cast a
gentle shadow around the neck.  She spread out her
arms.
</p>

<p>
"Kiss me," she said.
</p>

<p>
He smiled and leaned condescendingly toward her.
</p>

<p>
"What's your hurry?" she murmured.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her, and the weak light and the
strong liquor stood her in good stead.
</p>

<p>
"I ain't in no hurry," he smiled.
</p>

<p>
She met him smile for smile&mdash;and then, in a sudden
sense of triumph, she flung back her head and
laughed.
</p>

<p>
It was not until three hours later that he finally
left her, but he left hurriedly, for the remorseless
gray light of morning was coming in at the window,
and it fell upon her as she wrapped a soiled pink
kimona around her shivering figure and slipped her
feet into a pair of rundown Turkish slippers.
</p>

<p>
"Good-by," he said, looking away from her.
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute," said Mary.  "I'll go with you
to the door."
</p>

<p>
She did go.  She followed him down the dark
stairway, creaking noisily under their shamed feet,
and she stood for a moment in the black hall, holding
the brass knob of the door, as he passed to the step
outside.  Mary slipped the dead-latch, ready to bolt
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Max," she said.
</p>

<p>
He turned quickly, nearly knocking over, as he
did so, the milk-bottles that were lined, in a white
row, upon the step.
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" he returned, and grinned sheepishly.
</p>

<p>
She thrust out her towsled head and looked up
and down the gray morning street.  The block was
empty.  She drew her head clear of the door.  She
was still trembling, but from neither cold nor fear.
</p>

<p>
"You ain't goin' without kissin' me?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
But a reaction of disgust had seized him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am," he said.
</p>

<p>
Mary's one hand tightened on the knob; the other
flattened itself against the nearest panel of the door,
ready to push hard.
</p>

<p>
"All right," she replied, with a sudden change
in her voice that, still low, became tense and metallic.
"You think I'm&mdash;I'm done for, Max.  Well&mdash;<i>you're
done for, too!</i>"
</p>

<p>
The man's jaw dropped.  His olive face was
ashen.  His eyes stared.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Mary's mouth was wreathed in a smile.
</p>

<p>
"You know," she answered.
</p>

<p>
Max retreated so suddenly that he nearly fell
down the stone steps.
</p>

<p>
"You've&mdash;you've&mdash;&mdash;" he gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mary.
</p>

<p>
"It's a lie!  You're tryin' to scare me!"  His
jaw worked spasmodically.  "It's a damned lie!"
he repeated.
</p>

<p>
"You don't believe me?" the girl inquired.
</p>

<p>
If she had looked for heroics, if she had feared
melodrama, she was as yet disappointed.  The knees
of Max shook under him; he was in abject terror.
</p>

<p>
"It's a lie," he muttered over and over.  "It's
a damn' lie!"
</p>

<p>
"Think what you please," said Mary.  She was
still smiling, still serene.  "You believed I'd forgot,
didn't you?  Well, I didn't forget, Max Grossman,
an' now you'll remember.  If you don't yet think
I'm givin' you a straight story, all you have to do
is just one thing: <i>wait</i>."
</p>

<p>
Max uttered an inarticulate cry and threw himself
at her, but he only bashed his head against the
closed door.
</p>

<p>
Mary had shut it, and in time.  Behind it, in the
dark hallway, she lay half fainting.
</p>

<p>
"It's the last of you, Max," she laughed.
</p>

<p>
And it was.

<h3>
XXVIII
<br><br>
HUSKS OF THE SWINE
</h3>

<p>
Mary was too ill to go to work that night,
and on the night following she was no
better.  The shock, the spasm of success,
the recoil, not moral but physical, after the
satisfaction of a supreme desire&mdash;these things were, of
themselves, enough to leave her prostrate.  But, in
addition to these, she had, while standing at that
open door, contracted one of those heavy colds to
which she was now rendered especially susceptible.
Through long hours of the day and the darkness
she tossed among the hot sheets of her bed, sometimes
with her teeth clicking in a chill, again with
her body burning in a fever, but always revolving
in her seething brain the details of the vengeance that
she had wrought.
</p>

<p>
Her physical sufferings mattered little to her.
There were hours when she was wholly incapable of
feeling them.  When the inertia of the state of
reaction began at last to wear away, it left her with
a glow of recollection so great that there seemed
no place for lesser sensation.  She had accomplished
her great work, she had achieved her mission.  What
she had done had been done solely for her own
heart's sake; there had been no delusion of a celestial
command, no distorted thought of a social duty; yet,
the impulse, however utilitarian, had been supreme,
and its end filled her with a sense of triumph that,
for want of the proper title, she was sure was happiness.
</p>

<p>
A wiser head and an unwounded heart would have
known enough of life to see that even Max Grossman
was not entirely to blame.  A better brain could
have looked back into the past.  It could have seen
Max as the type of all his kind, the symbol of every
one of the great company of slavers, the inevitable
result of a system blind both to its own interests
and to the interests of the race.  It could have seen
the child, one of half a dozen born to a woman that
could not, properly, have cared for three.  It could
have seen that child neglected, dirty, forgotten,
locked, by day, in the bedroom where the whole
family tried vainly to sleep by night, learning the
highest facts of life from the worst of teachers: the
cramped childish brain&mdash;and going out, at last, upon
the street, with passions prematurely developed and
perverted.  It could have seen the social order shape
that child into society's enemy: the starved boy-pickpocket
sent to the monstrously misnamed "reformatory";
the same child branded as a criminal, with
none to shelter or to trust him, and with a knowledge,
gained in the state's own institution, which
fitted him to be only a crafty gorilla to harass the
state.  It could have seen the fatal line of least
resistance as clearly in the resultant man as it is seen
in the life of him that does no more than wreck a
bank or steal a corporation, and, hideous as its
course is in the one instance, it would have seen that
the line was the same in all.
</p>

<p>
But Mary never doubted her justice, and never
regretted it.  One only thought troubled her: she
was afraid that, by telling Max, she might have
given him a warning sufficiently early to defeat her
own ultimate purpose.  It was a large part of her
plan that he should know whose hand had struck
him, and, for a man in his business, the only way
in which she could make that knowledge certain was
the way that she had followed.  Yet what if he were
in time to profit by her information?  What if, even
were he too late, he should guard and doctor himself
with proper caution?  She turned the questions over
and over in her mind, but she had always to end in
the faith that the worst had happened.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, in the moments of exhaustion from
the mad round of these inquiries, she reverted for
relief to matters that touched her less nearly,
and endeavored to occupy herself with the affairs
of others.  She thought of Dyker, and without
resentment.  She knew that he would use her written
retraction to regain Marian's confidence, and she
hoped that he would be successful.  Again she fell
to speculating upon the fate of Carrie Berkowicz
and to wondering what had become of Katie.  But
upon her own past and present she did not permit
herself to dwell, and always, with the certainty
of a machine, her brain recurred to Max and her
vengeance on him.
</p>

<p>
On the third evening, however, her landlady,
entering with supper, reminded her, without mincing
matters, that the rent was due, and Mary recalled
that her little stock of money was exhausted.
</p>

<p>
"Can you wait till to-morrow morning, Mrs. Foote?"
she asked.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Foote was an ample woman, with round
cheeks and robust frame, whose only dissipations
were an over-indulgence in ritualism, babies, and
the hospital.  She had a high-church cleric to whom
she confessed the sins of her neighbors; a wraithlike
husband whose sole occupation appeared to be that
indispensable to the regular increase of her
family&mdash;and whom she would otherwise have failed
altogether to tolerate&mdash;and such a passion for being ill
that she could never quite believe in the illnesses of
others.
</p>

<p>
"I can wait just that long, Miss Morton," she
said; "but I'm sufferin' so from rheumatism in my
fingers that I just know my old gastric trouble is
comin' on ag'in, an' that'll mean another of them
hospital-bills."
</p>

<p>
Mary raised her aching head.
</p>

<p>
"You won't have to wait any longer," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad of it, Miss Morton," responded Mrs. Foote,
"for there was a young lady lookin' at this
room to-day an' she offered me a dollar more a
week for it, an' I wouldn't like to lose you."
</p>

<p>
"You won't lose me," said Mary, to whom even
sustained conversation was physical pain.  "I'm
goin' out to-night, an' I'll have plenty for you by
the mornin'."
</p>

<p>
"You're sure?" asked the landlady.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am.  It'd be a pity if I couldn't earn
that much."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Foote looked at Mary's face and seemed to
doubt the foundation for her assurance.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she sighed, "I certainly hope you can."
</p>

<p>
For some minutes after the door closed, Mary lay
still.  She had again been brought face to face with
the most poignant of tragedies, the tragedy of living.
</p>

<p>
An hour earlier, had she questioned herself, she
would have said that she was careless of life, that
neither this earth nor the quitting of it interested her,
that continued existence was a matter of indifference.
Then she was in that state of exultation above things
mundane which is produced only by great sorrow,
great joy, or the great revenges that are both grief
and triumph.  But now the words of the landlady
had brought her back from the indulgence of
contemplation to the necessity of action.  Mary's
insidious, implacable disease had completed what her
business had begun, and what her business alone would
have completed far more slowly.  The few emotions
that she was now capable of feeling were the more
intense because of their rarity, but their intensity was
equaled by their brevity and, when the moment had
gone, it left her even more of a moral weakling than
it had found her.
</p>

<p>
She knew Mrs. Foote and her tribe too well to
deceive herself as to what must happen should the
morning dawn upon an empty stocking.  Life held
nothing for which Mary greatly cared, but the instant
of death contained all of which she was afraid.
She did not greatly want to harm others by plying
her trade in her present condition, but she could not
think of others.  Each step would be a separate
wound to her tortured body and her throbbing head,
but she understood that the landlady had to wring
out the rents by the means that conditions had forced
upon her; and so the worst of fears, the fear of
poverty, which is the fear of death, took this sick
woman from her bed, dressed her in her best frock,
and sent her out into the street.
</p>

<p>
Along Sixth Avenue, where fortune had often,
theretofore, been kind to her, she met no significant
glances.  A passing girl or two, having missed her
for the last few evenings, proffered a casual
sympathy; but that was all.  Through the open doors
of the Haymarket, she turned in, but there even the
women at first disregarded her.  Several men that
she recognized in the boxes of the gallery around
the little hall nodded, but immediately looked away.
The one man that she happened to know better than
any of the others did not appear at all to remember
her, and his neighbor, who had frequently
accompanied her, signaled elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
She was lonely.  She approached two women who
were circling the floor, arm in arm.  She addressed
them with the familiarity of the craft.
</p>

<p>
"Hello," she said.
</p>

<p>
The one woman smiled, but her companion, a
formidable, tailor-made personage, swelled with dignity.
</p>

<p>
"You better beat it," she declared.
</p>

<p>
Mary flushed.
</p>

<p>
"What's eatin' you?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
"You don't belong here," the woman answered.
She made a lofty survey of Mary's finery, and then
added: "Goin'?"
</p>

<p>
Mary's heart sickened, but she stood her ground.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said, "I ain't."
</p>

<p>
The floor-manager was passing.  The social
arbiter turned to him.
</p>

<p>
"Will," she asked, and her shrill voice seemed to
carry over all the room; "what's this place comin'
to?  Throw that Fourteenth Street woman out o'
here!"
</p>

<p>
This was enough.  Mary left the place, and, still
aching in every limb, turned through a narrow
cross-street to Broadway.  Her eyes swam as she lingered
before shop-windows in the hope that someone she
passed would accost her.  Her throat was dry and
it hurt her when she hummed into the ears of
careless pedestrians.  Nobody seemed to heed her.  The
night was cold, and she shook like a recovering
drunkard.  She mastered all her strength to speak
plainly to a complacent man in a great ulster.
</p>

<p>
"Hello!" she said, trying to smile.  "What's
your hurry?"
</p>

<p>
The man looked at her and swore.
</p>

<p>
"You must think I'm blind," he ended.
</p>

<p>
She knew that she looked ill, but she knew that
she must find money.  She pleaded with age, because
she knew it to be æsthetically tolerant; she ogled
youth, because she knew it to be inexperienced; and
she stationed herself at last near a saloon in a poorly
lighted quarter, because she concluded that the men
leaving such places were the only men to whom she
was just then fitted successfully to appeal.  It was
one o'clock in the morning before she could induce
even one of these to give way to her, and he,
staggering with drink so that she had to support him
with all her ebbing powers, insisted on stopping in
an alleyway when, for the first time, she picked a
pocket.  A dollar and a half was all that she had
as she left him, and the next dark figure that she
stopped&mdash;she did not look at his face or care what
sort of face it was&mdash;answered her with sharp laughter.
</p>

<p>
"A two-spot?" he cackled.  "You have a few
more thinks comin', old girl!"
</p>

<p>
"A dollar?" suggested Mary, tremulously.
</p>

<p>
"I got just a half&mdash;an' you ain't worth a cent
more."
</p>

<p>
She took it&mdash;what would she not have taken?&mdash;and
she worked on into the dawn, on with a mounting
fever and a sick determination, knowing now
that her chances grew with the approach of morning
and finding herself, when at last the morning came,
with scarcely a dollar beyond the sum due for rent.
</p>

<p>
During all the months that followed she skirted
the dire edge of starvation, more than half the time
too ill to rise from her bed and aware that she was
at no moment fit to rise.  As her cold grew steadily
better her deeper illness steadily increased.  It
thrived on every exertion and seemed to gain each
atom of strength that she lost.  Things might thus
continue for almost any period, but she knew that
her manner of life forbade absolute cure, and that,
at the end, there waited a slow and loathsome death.
Anticipation made her faint; the melancholia and
terror, which are symptomatic, sometimes nearly
maddened her.  The last vestiges of the moral sense,
so early injured by previous experience, were almost
wholly destroyed; there was no social consciousness;
the appeal of the individual widened until it
occupied her entire horizon; there was room for nothing
but the craven passion for life.
</p>

<p>
Fat Dr. Helwig, when she went to see him, blinked
at her out of his deep-set eyes, and told her that she
was not taking sufficient rest.
</p>

<p>
Mary twisted her helpless hands.
</p>

<p>
"How can I afford to take it?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Save your money," said he, patting her thin
shoulders, and chuckling prosperously.  "You girls
never put aside a cent."
</p>

<p>
"We don't earn enough."
</p>

<p>
"Poof!  That's what you all say.  I know&mdash;I
know.  We men aren't such fools as you take us
for."
</p>

<p>
But Mary, as each evening she made up before
her little mirror, noted the gradual depreciation of
her wares; each week she found it harder to pay
rent and retain enough money for food.  Mrs. Foote
seemed to come every day, instead of every seventh,
and yet each night business grew more difficult.
Whenever Mary missed a few evenings, or whenever
she changed her hunting-grounds, the police needed
fresh payments.  She surrendered one uptown cross-street
after another.  At last she deserted Broadway
and patrolled only that Fourteenth Street which the
woman at the Haymarket had so scornfully referred
to and which had so wonderfully burst upon Mary's
sight when she first stepped from the Hudson Tunnel
upon the surface of Manhattan.
</p>

<p>
Spring, summer, and autumn passed, and a lean
winter followed them.  Mary caught another cold
and was ill for a week.  She went to work too soon
and had to go back to bed for several days and
remain idle for several nights.  At last, with the
ancient fear of the white race&mdash;the fear of that
poverty which is death&mdash;gnawing at her vitals, she
struggled to her feet and tramped once more along
Fourteenth Street from Sixth Avenue to Third.
</p>

<p>
But now the sword descended.  Even the Fourteenth
Street saloon best known for her purposes
gave no fish to her net, and Eighth Street was little
better.  She was too tired to go farther; she had,
the next morning, to offer Mrs. Foote only a third
of what was due.
</p>

<p>
The landlady, whose bulk seemed to crowd the
hall-bedroom, leaned heavily against its frail door.
Mary thought the woman's slow, brown eyes more
than commonly suspicious and her round face
implacably hard.  The tenant, with all explanation
frozen upon her lips, handed over the clinking bits
of money.  They fell into the big, extended palm as
a few drops of water might fall into a basin.
Mrs. Foote began slowly to count the coins.
</p>

<p>
Mary watched, in fascinated silence, the counting
of those few pieces of silver, each one of which
seemed stained with her blood.  She saw the landlady's
expression change to one of incredulity.  She
saw the counting repeated.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Foote again thrust out her grimy fingers.
</p>

<p>
"What's this?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
"It's&mdash;&mdash;"  Mary looked at the floor.  "It's the
rent," she concluded, in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
"<i>What's</i> the rent?"
</p>

<p>
"That's all I have&mdash;just now.  I thought&mdash;I
thought, considerin' how long I've been here, you
might wait a day for the rest, Mrs. Foote."
</p>

<p>
The landlady opened her hand, and Mary's little
store of coin dropped to the bed.
</p>

<p>
"I can't take this," she said.
</p>

<p>
"You mean," asked Mary, with a quick gasp of
hope, "that you'll let me keep it till I get the rest?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't mean nothin' of the sort," said Mrs. Foote.
"I mean I've got to have the whole bill&mdash;right now."
</p>

<p>
Mary's heart sank.
</p>

<p>
"That's all I have," she said.
</p>

<p>
She had sunk to a seat on the tumbled bed, beside
her scattered coins.  Her thin hands were locked
across her knees; the dirty pink kimona slipped lower
from her shoulders at every frequent cough, and
her eyes sought those of Mrs. Foote in dumb appeal.
Her russet hair fell dully disordered about her
hollow cheeks, and the rouge on her lips was purple.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," pursued Mrs. Foote, who was too
used to such incidents greatly to concern herself;
"but I've got to make my living like anybody else
does."
</p>

<p>
"I was expectin' some money this evenin'," said
Mary.
</p>

<p>
"Hump!" sniffed the landlady.
</p>

<p>
"You don't believe that?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't care, Miss Morton; I can't care."
</p>

<p>
"But I"&mdash;Mary's fingers knotted tighter about
her knees&mdash;"I was promised it," she lied, "an' I'm
dead sure to get it then."
</p>

<p>
"I've heard that so many times," said Mrs. Foote,
"that I knowed it by heart three year' ago."
</p>

<p>
"I could pawn somethin'," suggested Mary.
</p>

<p>
The landlady swept the bare room with a critical
glance.
</p>

<p>
"What?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
There was no adequate answer to be made.
Mary had tried to pledge her coat a few days before,
and had been offered only an inadequate twenty-five
cents for it.
</p>

<p>
"Then you won't&mdash;you can't wait?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I can't.  I'm a sick woman myself; my
rent's due, Miss Mary, an' the honest truth is that
there's such a lot of women wantin' rooms that I'd
only be doin' a injustice to my children not to take
in a lady that could pay prompt&mdash;for a while."
</p>

<p>
Mary said nothing more.  She packed her few
belongings into her trunk, left it in the hall to be
called for, and, as the chill evening fell, went away
from the house with no idea where she was to find
a lodging for the night.  For an hour, though she
was still weak, and the time was as yet so early, she
walked up Broadway and, in the Forties, turned
eastward for a few blocks, and so south again.  Not
far from the Grand Central Station she saw a little
crowd gathered at a corner, and she stopped, rather
for the luxury of standing still than from any
curiosity.
</p>

<p>
The place was a church.  Colored lights streamed
from its rich stained-glass windows.  Through its
swinging doors there stole the scent of flowers and
the sound of delicate music.  A long row of
carriages, the coachmen walking up and down to keep
warm, stretched far around the corner.
</p>

<p>
Mary, shivering, worked her way quietly through
the group of men and women on the sidewalk.  In
order to avoid a particularly entangled portion of
the press, she started to walk along the steps by the
tower-entrance, and then, seeing a side-door open,
she listlessly turned toward it and looked in.
</p>

<p>
Far away up the vaulted nave the altar stood,
white with damask and yellow with candles.  The
chancel was a garden, the whole building heavy with
scent.  Acolytes in scarlet were grouped about the
robed priests.  The choir had risen and, preceded
by a lad that bore aloft a great brass cross, were
forming into a singing procession, which slowly filed
down the center aisle.
</p>

<p>
With a subdued scuffle and swish, the congregation
also rose as the double line of choristers moved
between them.  Women craned their necks and men,
pretending to look stolidly ahead of them, looked
really out of the corners of their eyes.  The choir,
at the main door, divided and stood still.  High
overhead a deep-toned organ was playing the
wedding-march from Lohengrin, and through the
respectful line of white-clad boys there moved a man
of regular features with lowered lids that hid his
eyes, and a crisp brown mustache, which concealed
his lips, and, on his arm, in the costume of a bride,
a tall, graceful, pure woman, whose face was like
a Greek cameo and in whose hand was a huge bunch
of orchids and lilies-of-the-valley.
</p>

<p>
The fingers of a policeman touched Mary's arm.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to get back," he said.  "The
people'll be comin' out in a minute."
</p>

<p>
But Mary did not wish to move.
</p>

<p>
"I've got a right here," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"You?" The policeman looked at her, and then
laughed.  "What right?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't that Miss Lennox?"
</p>

<p>
"It was."
</p>

<p>
"And Judge Dyker?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I gave him his marriage-license."
</p>

<p>
The policeman's good-nature was amused, but he
forced her back to the street.
</p>

<p>
"No use," he said.
</p>

<p>
"An' I guess," said Mary bitterly&mdash;"I guess I
paid for the bride's bouquet."
</p>

<p>
He did not reply, nor would she have heard him
had he spoken, for in the stream of lesser guests now
flowing from the rear of the church, which had been
assigned to them, she was met by Katie Flanagan.
</p>

<p>
Not the piquant Katie of that photograph which
used to adorn the bureau in the shabby tenement of
bachelor Hermann Hoffmann, or the saucy girl of
the second-hand clothing-store, or yet the frightened
clerk that had at first evaded and at last defied the
whiskered Mr. Porter.  Those days were patently
passed; Katie, like many another strong soul, had
faced temptation and conquered it; and in the stead
of the old days had come new days that brought a
maturity and a dignity with which Katie was
consciously satisfied.  Her blue eyes were as glad as
Mary remembered them, but their happiness was
calm; her black hair was gathered in a formal knot,
and her gown, though a better gown than that she
used to wear, was of a simplicity almost severe.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, when she saw Mary, who sought
evasion, Katie came frankly forward with
outstretched hand.  She recognized with regret, the
change in her former acquaintance, but, knowing, as
she must have known, its cause, she decided to ask
no questions concerning it, and, if she offered no
assistance, she at least proffered no advice.
</p>

<p>
"I just come to see the last o' Miss Marian," she
explained.  "Near the half of old Rivington Street's
been tucked in here among th' swells to give the
good word to her&mdash;Jews an' Irish&mdash;an' if the rabbis
won't mind for the sheenies to come to such a heathen
church, I thought Father Kelly might manage to
forgive me."
</p>

<p>
Mary's brain was just then too dull to make any
but a commonplace answer.
</p>

<p>
"You're lookin' well," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I ought to be, though there's a youngster
expected.  I tell Hermann&mdash;we was married a few
weeks after last election&mdash;I don't know how we'll
keep a family; but he just whistles an' says we'll
make out some way, an' I guess we will."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad," said Mary, "that you're married."
</p>

<p>
"Well, so am I&mdash;most of the time.  Of course,
the man has some queer ideas, but I'm doin' me
best, with Father Kelly's help, to get 'em out of
the head of him, an' nowadays, when he goes to
one of them Socialist meetin's by night, I make him
make up by goin' with me to early mass next mornin'."
</p>

<p>
She paused and surveyed again the pale woman
before her.  Essentially Katie had not changed.  She
had still, and would always have, the big, kind heart
and the ready hand of her earlier days.  But her
condition had altered, and Mary's had evidently
again fallen; she looked through an alien atmosphere,
and her gaze was distant: the responsibilities
and adjustment of young married life shackled her,
and must continue to shackle her until they were no
longer new.  She did not know how to suggest any
assistance, did not even believe that it was desired;
but, though she still felt that she must refrain from
intimate inquiry, one effort she tried to make.
</p>

<p>
"An' you," she asked&mdash;"how're you gettin' on, Mary?"
</p>

<p>
Mary bit her lip.
</p>

<p>
"Fine," she answered, huskily.
</p>

<p>
"Are you&mdash;&mdash;?  There ain't&mdash;&mdash;?"  Katie floundered
in a maze that she would, a few months previously
or a few months in the future, have cut her
way through with a strong directness.  "There ain't
nothin' I could&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
Mary's head shook, almost mechanically.  It was
not entirely that she felt unable to accept assistance
from her former protector; it was rather that she
felt only that she must run away.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," she said, forcing a smile.  "I'm doin'
grand."
</p>

<p>
The gala crowd was sweeping about them.  It
jostled both girls and threatened momentarily to
separate them.  After all, there was nothing more
to be said.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I got to go," murmured Mary.  "I got an
appointment&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But you'll come to see us sometime, won't you
Mary?" asked Katie, and she gave her address.
"We'll have a fine party at the christening an' I'll
want you to see the baby."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," said Mary; "yes, of course."
</p>

<p>
But Katie was hesitant.
</p>

<p>
"You're sure I can't do nothin'?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, no.  I&mdash;&mdash;"  Mary caught and pressed with
what warmth there was left in her fingers, the Irish
girl's hand.  "Good-by," she concluded, and then,
in order to keep up the farce of an appointment, she
got upon a passing car.
</p>

<p>
Even if panic had not possessed her, she could
not have accepted anything that Katie might offer.
The most that could have been given her would have
been but temporary, and what she must have was a
means of earning a living.
</p>

<p>
She rode well downtown, and then walked farther
southward.  She slipped along the broad, yellow-lighted
Bowery, gathering one or two quarters on
her way, and wandered into the narrow, serpentine,
fevered alleys of Chinatown.  When an ugly rain
began to fall, the open door of a mission attracted
her, and she went in to rest.
</p>

<p>
It was the typical mission-room, very different
from the uptown church where she had seen the
wedding.  This new place was mean; it had a low
ceiling and was none too clean.  The lights were flaring
and the dull walls were enlivened by boldly lettered
Bible texts.  The air was close; on the platform, at
the front of the place, a well-fed man was pleading,
in sweat and tears, the cause of his religion; nearby,
his double was making ready the reed-organ.
Crowded into the unsteady benches were pimpled
boys with lolling mouths and preternaturally knowing
eyes; youths already old in disease and drink and
crime; full-grown men, frog-eyed or blear-eyed, who
needed only the faculty of firmness and the chance
to cultivate it; old men, who had lost their hold upon
work in a country still too barbarous to pension its
aged; and, though there were no young girls, here
and there Mary saw a few women, bedraggled,
sodden, hideous, because men had at some time thought
them <i>chic</i>, dainty, beautiful.
</p>

<p>
One of the "workers" attached to the place&mdash;a
bland, prosperous man, with a pleasant
smile&mdash;approached Mary and shook her hand as if he were
an old acquaintance.  He had fat red cheeks, firm
teeth, and kindly eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad to see you, sister," he said.  "Are you
saved?"
</p>

<p>
Mary's childhood had heard some of the phraseology
of evangelicalism.  She understood, but she
had come to receive worldly, not spiritual, warmth.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said, "I ain't."
</p>

<p>
The "worker," however, was accustomed to that
reply.  He patted her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Mary, "I never thought much about Him."
</p>

<p>
She looked at the floor.  She was cold and hungry
and afraid.
</p>

<p>
"Then," responded the man, with genuine earnestness,
"you ought to begin to think.  No man knoweth
the hour of His comin'.  He is ready with the
Free Gift.  Don't you want to come to Him?"
</p>

<p>
Mary's life had been one in which there had been
small time for the cultivation of religious emotion,
and no time at all for the cultivation of religious
thought.  At her home she had learned as much by
rote as she had had to learn, but what she got she
held only as so many tasks performed.  The words
were lessons to be mastered; if they had any relation
to facts, those facts were things not to be faced until
an age of discretion, and, pending the arrival of that
age, the lessons had been stored away with a bland,
childish practicality.  What followed later had
driven out all that preceded it.  The shock of her
capture; the wild, new order of existence; the
endeavor to escape; the battle of service among new
conditions; and, at last, the dulling of all the finer
sensibilities and the final fight for a mere chance to
continue alive&mdash;these were circumstances neither
propitious to theology nor favorable to faith.
</p>

<p>
She glanced at the mission-worker, and then
glanced away.
</p>

<p>
"I dunno," she said.  "I guess I ain't the kind
of woman religion can do much for."
</p>

<p>
"Don't say that," protested the man.  His eyes
shone with zeal and his voice was tender.  "His
grace is free for all who come.  His mercy is from
everlastin' to everlastin'.  I've been a sinner
myself"&mdash;the speaker's voice swelled with a real pride&mdash;"a
terrible sinner, an' I know what I say, praise the
Lord.  The meaner an' viler we are, the more Jesus
needs us.  Just open your heart.  Just accept Him,
an' you'll never know no more trouble in this world
nor the next."
</p>

<p>
"Would I get a job?" asked Mary.
</p>

<p>
The man shook his head, sadly.
</p>

<p>
"That ain't no way to think about salvation,"
he declared.  "What's freely given ought to be
freely received.  Now is the appointed time."
</p>

<p>
"But I gotta make a livin'."
</p>

<p>
"I know it, I know it.  We've all got to do that,
but ain't it better to make one an' be saved than to
make one an' be sent to hell-fire?"
</p>

<p>
She assented.  "Only," she added, "I don't want
to starve, even if I am saved."
</p>

<p>
It was his old difficulty.
</p>

<p>
"I know," he repeated; "an' we'd only be too
glad to get you work if we could, but times are hard
an' we've got a waitin'-list of fifty at this very minute.
Here's some meal-tickets, sister, fer we want to do
what we can, an' we know it's hard to save souls on
empty stomachs.  You just think it over an' see if
I'm not right about religion."
</p>

<p>
She took the tickets and used them at a five-cent
eating-house during the next day.  That night she
managed to secure a bed in a room over a saloon&mdash;a
narrow, stuffy room that she shared with three other
women of her own sort; but the next night she earned
nothing, and she had been compelled to pawn her
coat for food.  She sought a bench in Union Square,
where two tattered men made room for her.  They
gave her, to wrap about her chest, newspapers that
they had gathered from the gutter; and she dozed
until the sharp command of a policeman scattered
her comrades, when they made their way to the rear
of the Flatiron Building and stood, for warmth, over
a grill that sent up occasional blasts of heat from
the basement.
</p>

<p>
The rapidity with which one may descend from
bad to worse is to be believed only by those who
have been penniless and friendless in the larger cities.
During the nights that followed, when Mary's
clothes grew speedily ragged, dirty, and odorous,
and when she earned just enough money to postpone
starvation, she became a familiar of Chinatown,
learned something of its blind paths and the tangled
passages of its fetid tenements.  The almond-eyed
Orientals tolerantly received her.  She came to know
the heavy odors of the opium, to chat with clay-white
American girls, morphine-eaters, and cocaine
and chloral victims, whose Chinese lovers were kind
to them, and who never wanted to breathe the open
air.  She was borne with, but the market was
over-supplied there, and she found no regular keeper.
She came to envy the drug-enslaved women who had
first sought the Mott Street district as missionaries,
even the little Mongolian girls over whose slavery,
so much lighter than her own, the city, from time to
time, grew ludicrously excited.  Her illness
progressed, but, thanks to her hardy birth and the
exercise of what care was at all possible, it progressed
with a step so tardy as to give no indication of
reaching its tragic end, other things being equal, for two
years or more.  She did not again go to see the
doctor; she did not have to.  The only things that
he could have advised were the things that she was
in no position to do.  Beyond a certain limited
amount of routine care, she was helpless.
</p>

<p>
One night, wet and exhausted, she met a sailor in
Chatham Square, and drank long with him.
</p>

<p>
"Where you goin' to sleep to-night?" he asked,
as they were about to part.
</p>

<p>
He was a short, black-browed man, who walked
with a bow-legged roll.  The short sleeves of his
jacket displayed sinewy, bronze wrists with anchors
tattooed upon them.  His neck rose out of his low-cut
mariner's shirt like the neck of a brown, fighting
bull, and his black eyes, set deep under bushy,
frowning brows, were red, like those of a bull that is
dangerous.  He had been taken with a drunken passion
for her, and though, when he kissed her, his upper
lip scraped her face like a file, though his incessant
grip of her hands hurt her, and though his heavy
foot, seeking hers beneath the saloon-table, nearly
crushed her own, she had to answer him with the
professional smile.
</p>

<p>
"I dunno where I'll sleep," she said.  "I guess
Lee Hung's Letty'll put me up."
</p>

<p>
The sailor chucked her pointed chin so roughly
that she thought her neck would crack.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you come along o' me?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Where's that?"
</p>

<p>
"To one o' our places.  I know a beauty, an' I'll
take good care o' you, an' afterward you can stay on."
</p>

<p>
"One of your places?  What's those?"
</p>

<p>
"Places we visit.  Places for seafarin' men.  I
tells you I knows a daisy&mdash;Big Lou's keepin' it&mdash;an'
they needs a new gal there, for I stopped in as I
come ashore this evenin' an' they tole me the one
I knew after last voyage was buried only yesterday."
</p>

<p>
Mary shuddered.
</p>

<p>
"Is it all right?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"All right?  Course it's all right.  But mind
you,"&mdash;his black eyes leaped into a sudden threat&mdash;"I'm
takin' you to-night.  No philanderin'.  For
this night y'er my gal."
</p>

<p>
She looked away.
</p>

<p>
"Mind you that," he drunkenly repeated.  "I'm
mostly as gentle as Nathan's lamb, but when I'm
tricked I'm ready with my hands.  It's all right.
It's a good place for a good time.  Plenty to drink
an' the best o' company.  Better come.  I can fix it
so's you can get a steady job there."
</p>

<p>
She shivered again, but she could not see why she
should shiver.  After all, she was glad to learn of
any place where she would be sure of food to eat
and a roof to cover her&mdash;and so she came to Summerton's.

<br><br>
THE DOORS OF THE SHADOW
</h3>

<p>
It is a winding and tortuous way across Greenwich
Village to Summerton's.  The mazed course
runs through streets that squirm like worms between
a fisherman's fingers; it skirts cobbled courts
that are in twilight at midday and damp in the
longest drought; it turns and doubles up passages that
seem blind, dodges through the very bones of tumble-down
warehouses, storehouses, houses so ramshackle
that the imagination can conjure no possible use for
them, and it comes out at last into a foul thoroughfare
that appears to be no better than a stinking
alley, so close to the water's edge that the masts
of the river's cluttered craft look as if they grew
upon the dirty, sagging roofs opposite, and so near
to the wharves that the green walls of the buildings
are wet and odorous as if from a continuous
application of bilge-water.
</p>

<p>
By day, when its residents are asleep, this street
is loud with straining Norman horses, and clattering
vans, and whip-cracking carters from the docks; but
by night&mdash;and the nights are very dark down there&mdash;it
becomes the haunt of sailors and longshoremen,
drunk and shouting, or still and drugged.  Then
the blue electric lamps snap hysterically at distant
corners; the uneven pavement mounts steeply upward,
or dashes precipitately downward, with no
warning; laughter and curses and the crash of breaking
glass or spluttering oaths issue now and again
from the blackness at one's elbow, where, hidden
among the warehouses, stand the houses for the storing
of another sort of wares: the slave-houses
maintained for mariners.  Grotesque men, could you see
them, stagger into dim entrances; terrible caricatures
of women, if the light would show them, steal out
and dart upon gutter-couched drunkards to paw their
pockets.  The night is alive with shadows, and the
whole street a hungry, quivering quicksand.
</p>

<p>
Only by urging her eyes to their utmost could
Mary make out anything of the house before which
she and her unsteady companion came to pause.
Even then all of which she could be sure was that,
cowering under the shadow of some huge brick
building, and skulking beneath its own rotting eaves,
it was a half-sunken, old, narrow house, long since
abandoned as unfit for legitimate purposes, and
leaning rakishly to one side, like an ancient libertine
that knows his evil and grins at it.
</p>

<p>
The sailor knocked lightly at an almost unseen
door.  A panel of it slid open and threw a ray of
light on his face.
</p>

<p>
"Who's there?" asked a voice that was like the
rasping of a file.
</p>

<p>
"It's Billy," said the sailor.
</p>

<p>
"Billy who?"
</p>

<p>
"Billy Stevens.  Le'me in, Lou."
</p>

<p>
A pair of swollen eyes came to the open panel
and looked, down the shaft of light, into the sinister
face of Bill.
</p>

<p>
"Who's that with you?" croaked the voice.
</p>

<p>
"A gal I got for you."
</p>

<p>
"Is she all right?"
</p>

<p>
"O' course she is, Lou; else what in hell'd she be
doin' with me?  Come on; le'me in."
</p>

<p>
The swollen eyes disappeared, and the panel was
shut.  There was a sound of the withdrawal of
several bolts.  Then the door swung open, was closed
and relocked behind the newcomers, and Mary found
herself in an unfurnished hall, not more than fifteen
feet square, lighted by a dim lamp standing on the
lowest step of a steep flight of stairs, and guarded
by the owner of the swollen eyes.
</p>

<p>
At least in height, "Big Lou" was gigantic.  She
was fully six feet tall; she stooped a little and was
extremely thin, with a hollow chest and narrow
flanks, partially hidden by an old red cotton
dressing-gown; but the long arms were like flails, and Lou
had a temper that did not hesitate to use them as
such.  Her dirty brown hair was already touched
with gray; she had almost no chin; her nose was a
smudge in her sodden face and her cheeks were heavy
with years of drunkenness.  Her mouth hung loose
and quarrelsome, and, as she bent over to look hard
at Mary, her breath was foul.
</p>

<p>
She addressed herself, however, entirely to the
black-browed Stevens.
</p>

<p>
"Where'd you git her?" she asked, as if Mary
were one of the animals not gifted with articulate
speech.
</p>

<p>
Stevens told of their meeting.
</p>

<p>
"Where's she from?"
</p>

<p>
The sailor gave a rapid and wholly fictitious biography.
</p>

<p>
"How old?"
</p>

<p>
"Twenty," said Bill.
</p>

<p>
"I ain't!" protested Mary.
</p>

<p>
But the sailor shot her an ugly look.
</p>

<p>
"Close your trap," he told her, and then, to Big
Lou, he repeated: "Twenty."
</p>

<p>
Big Lou picked up the lamp and, holding it in
one blackened claw, passed the other over Mary,
with dexterous appraisement, from shoulders to
knees.
</p>

<p>
"I'll give you a five-spot for her," she croaked.
</p>

<p>
"You'll go to the devil," retorted Bill.
</p>

<p>
"Six?"
</p>

<p>
"Ten."
</p>

<p>
"You're a damned thief, Stevens, that's what you
are," growled the old woman.  "I'll give you seven,
an' not another God damned cent."
</p>

<p>
Mary leaned against the moist wall.  She was now
past caring, and she hardly heard.
</p>

<p>
"Make it seven-seventy-five," said Bill, with
sudden ingratiation.
</p>

<p>
Big Lou raised the lamp again and again regarded
the animal, her swollen eyes sharpening.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you what I'll do," she said, once more
facing the sailor.  "Are you goin' to stop here
to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll come up in the mornin' and take a
closer look.  If she passes that, I'll give you
seven-fifty."
</p>

<p>
Bill's brown face worked in thought, but the
thirst for liquor was upon him, and he
compromised.
</p>

<p>
"All right," he said&mdash;"if you'll give me five
down on account."
</p>

<p>
The giantess flung aside her red dressing-gown
and, from a black cotton stocking that hung loose
upon a shriveled shank, drew a few greasy bills.
From these she reluctantly counted five, handed them
to Stevens, and returned the rest to their original
place of safety.
</p>

<p>
"G'on up," she said.  "I stay here till work's
done, an' take tolls."
</p>

<p>
From somewhere in the shadows she produced a
black flask and, as Mary, with the sailor's tattooed
hand tightly under her arm, began the steep ascent,
Big Lou settled herself at her post of gatekeeper
upon the lowest step.
</p>

<p>
Those stairs seemed almost perpendicular.  They
rose out of the darkness of the hallway at an alarming
angle; each step was close upon a foot high; they
were not a yard wide, their upper half was boxed
between two walls, and they opened directly into the
room that evidently served as the parlor of Big Lou
Summerton's establishment.
</p>

<p>
The room was small and badly lighted by a kerosene
hand-lamp, which stood upon a circular center-table
and sent up a thin column of smoke to the
sooty ceiling.  A spotted lounge with dilapidated
springs stood in one corner; the faded paper was
peeling from the plaster, and a broken stove, which
glowed an angry red, heated the place to a degree
that was well-nigh unbearable.  The air was stale
and rancid, both from the company that was present
and from a long entertainment of similar companies,
in days gone by.
</p>

<p>
There were only two persons in the room.  Both
were seated at the table, both were drinking whiskey
poured into ragged-edged glasses from a bottle that
stood between them, and both were, or had been,
women.  Of these one coughed so sharply and
constantly between her toothless gums, and was so
shrunken under her blue calico mother-hubbard, that
it was plain she would soon be nothing; while the
other was a creature with face red and bloated,
features stunted and coarse, eyes that glowed dully, and
the voice of a crow.
</p>

<p>
Stevens presented Mary to them, and wasted no
formalities.
</p>

<p>
"This here's a new one," he said, and, motioning
his charge to a third chair, himself pulled up a
fourth.
</p>

<p>
The two inmates received her with a loud duet
that was almost a choral jeer.  Two more glasses
were produced from a shadowy cupboard, and the
drinking recommenced.
</p>

<p>
Mary took one long drink and, wasted by privation,
passed at once for some time into a daze in
which, though she saw all, she reckoned little.  She
heard Stevens drop into the babbling stage of
drunkenness; she noted that, though the women kept pace
with his potations, they poured water into their own
whiskey and gin into the sailor's; she saw him loll
in his chair and sway over the table; she felt his
heavy head drop at last on her thin shoulder, and
she did not move while, as he lay there, his
companions&mdash;now hers&mdash;went through his clothes and
tiptoed out of a rear door.
</p>

<p>
It was then that, with a quick start, she regained
control of herself at the sound of speech below and
the tread of feet on the stairs.  A rough voice had
assured Big Lou that "it was all right," and another
voice was supplementing:
</p>

<p>
"Rest easy, my dear lady: we are paying as we
go.  Michael, here, is, as you know, a deck-hand
on the admirable yacht of my admirable friend
Marsden Payne, with whom I have been on
a winter excursion; and he has kindly consented
to show me his own section of little old New York."
</p>

<p>
Mary knew that voice, although she could not
at once identify it; but, though she sprang up so
quickly that she wakened the tumbling Stevens, who
slipped to the floor, she could not escape before she
found herself directly regarding the flushed face,
glowing gray eyes, and disordered hair of Philip
Beekman.
</p>

<p>
Still young and slim in his yachting clothes, he
looked at her, swaying a little in the doorway, his
back to those perilous stairs, and with no clear
recognition.
</p>

<p>
"Hello!" he said.  "I think I've had the
pleasure of meeting you somewhere before."
</p>

<p>
Mary's mouth tightened.  She had herself now
well in hand.  She shook her russet head.
</p>

<p>
"I guess not," she said.
</p>

<p>
But her voice betrayed her.
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!" said Beekman.  The flush deepened
on his face.  With one hand he snatched his
yachting-cap from his black hair; the other he
suddenly held out to her, trembling.  "Good Lord!" he
repeated, this time with something that was nearly
awe in his tone.  "I&mdash;I&mdash;it's <i>Violet</i>!  Will you&mdash;&mdash;?
Won't you <i>please</i> shake hands?"
</p>

<p>
Scarcely less amazed by his manner than was he
by her appearance, she took his hand.
</p>

<p>
Beekman turned to someone on the stairs behind him.
</p>

<p>
"Get out, Mike!" he said.  "I've found a friend."
</p>

<p>
There was a plucking at his sleeve and the murmur
of a concerned voice from the rear.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Philip; "get out.  I tell you that I
have found a friend.  Go down to the tall lady and
hand her your money and then make tracks for the
yacht.  You may tell Mr. Payne that I shall return
in an hour."
</p>

<p>
Again a muffled protest from the dangerous stairway.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me a moment," said Beekman, and
turned full around.  "Now, then," he continued to
his guide, "you get out.  I am perfectly well able
to take care of myself, and I want a private talk.
Do you expect me to kick you downstairs?  No?  I
should probably break your back if I did.&mdash;Then,
good-night."
</p>

<p>
He stood there while the deckhand's heavy feet
clattered downward; waited until he had heard Big
Lou grumblingly give Mike the means of exit, and
then he turned again to Mary.
</p>

<p>
"What," he rapidly began, and his handsome
face grew once more earnest, "what in the name of
heaven are you doing in this den?&mdash;No," he
continued, raising a quick hand; "don't tell me; I
remember how I sent you out of my mother's house
and, upon my word, I'm afraid to hear.  I couldn't
do anything else&mdash;but I don't know.  Anyhow, there's
one thing sure: you need money.  Well, I made a
little in the game to-night&mdash;not much for Payne, but
a good slice for me&mdash;and it's yours&mdash;it's yours&mdash;the
Lord knows it ought to go to you!"
</p>

<p>
She had tried to stop him until he spoke of money;
but when he mentioned that, she let him run on, let
him search his pockets, and at last let him thrust
something into her open hand.
</p>

<p>
"Here," he said; "take it; take it as a favor
to me; take it, and remember what I said to
you in Rose's.  Watch your chance; get out of
here; and for God's sake go back to your own
home."
</p>

<p>
Her fingers closed upon the bills and transferred
them to her stocking; and as she did this a movement
on the floor made them both turn.
</p>

<p>
Bill Stevens, whom Mary had forgotten and
whom Beekman had not seen, gathered himself together,
and at last stood more or less upright upon
his unsteady bowed legs.  His heavy body rocked
uneasily, but his dark face, with its bushy brows and
sinister eyes, was thrust forward glowering.  One
sinewy tattooed hand gripped the back of a chair;
the other, knotted into a hard fist, he raised slowly
toward Beekman.
</p>

<p>
"It's your turn to go," he said, with a lingering
oath.  "This here's my gal; she b'longs to me&mdash;an'
so does any money she gits."
</p>

<p>
Instantly Philip was his old, assured self.  That
quality which was most characteristic of him, that
curious mixture of much that was bitter and a little
that was sweet, lighted his eyes and rang in his
voice.
</p>

<p>
"Where do <i>you</i> come from?" he asked, smiling.
"You look as if you got out of a trap-door, like the
fairy in the play."
</p>

<p>
"None o' your business where I come from," said
Bill.  "The point is where I'll send you, if you ain't
careful."
</p>

<p>
Mary, who did not like the looks of things, tried
to interpose.  She put the palms of her hands against
the sailor's rough cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, Bill," she said, "this is an old friend
of mine&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Likely!" grunted Bill.
</p>

<p>
"He is, though; ain't you?" Mary appealed, with
a sidelong glance at Beekman.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly I am," said Philip.
</p>

<p>
Stevens lowered his fist, but his red eyes remained
full of hate.
</p>

<p>
"I don't care who you are," he rumbled; "this
here's my woman."
</p>

<p>
"All right," said Beekman; "that's to your
credit, I'm sure: a man is known by the woman he
keeps, and you can't have a better.  Only, you see,
my friend&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I ain't yer friend."
</p>

<p>
Once more Mary interposed.
</p>

<p>
"Just sit down, Bill," she urged.  "Sit down an'
have a drink with us.  You can hear all we got to
say."
</p>

<p>
Stevens sank into a chair, but when Beekman,
with Mary between them, pushed the bottle toward
Bill, the sailor would have none of it.
</p>

<p>
"I'll stop a bit," he said, "but I ain't goin' to
drink with you, an' you needn't think it."
</p>

<p>
Philip was still undisturbed.
</p>

<p>
"Have it your own way," he said.  "I know how
it is: when a man falls in love, he swears off liquor;
when he falls out of love he takes to liquor again&mdash;one
sort of drunkenness is as much as he can stand
at a time.  I'll take a drink."
</p>

<p>
Mary, who now began to fear acute trouble,
slipped a hand to Stevens, but he drew away.
</p>

<p>
"I think I'll smoke&mdash;if I may," continued the
undisturbed Beekman.  "A pipe is domestic, a cigar is
philosophic, and a cigarette is a cynic: I shall have
a cigarette.  William?"&mdash;And he offered his silver
case to the sailor.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Stevens, shortly.
</p>

<p>
Beekman tossed his head.  Mary saw his gray
eyes snap.
</p>

<p>
"William," he said, "you have got to learn that
the best girl is never so good as the next.  And
you have got to learn manners.  If you won't
behave yourself properly, I think you had better
leave."
</p>

<p>
Stevens's fingers opened and closed slowly.
</p>

<p>
"You go to hell," he said.
</p>

<p>
Beekman rose quietly.  His cigarette was in one
hand, and with the other, instead of threatening, he
pointed to the stairway.
</p>

<p>
"Run along," he said.
</p>

<p>
Stevens jumped to his feet and crouched, like a
panther ready to spring.  Mary, overturning her
chair, flung her arms about him and pinioned him in
an embrace.
</p>

<p>
"Don't, Bill!" she whispered, and, over her
shoulder: "Don't, Mr. Beekman!  Can't you two
be friends?  Can't you see it's all right, Bill?  Can't
you let him alone, Mr. Beekman?  Bill, you know
how much I think of you."
</p>

<p>
She put her lips to his rough face.  She whispered
rapid, unthought lies into his ear.  She caressed and
cajoled him, and at last, when Philip had been
persuaded into a half-scornful apology, she managed
to get Stevens out of the room and started him down
the stairway to seek sympathy of Big Lou while she
herself had her talk with Beekman.
</p>

<p>
They sat down again at the round table and took
a drink.  Philip wanted to upbraid himself for his
conduct to her in his mother's house, and yet,
because he felt that he could have followed no course
save that which he had taken, he did not know how
to begin: all that he was sure of was that there was
a wrong somewhere, and that he must somehow make
confession of it.  Mary, on the other hand, was
divided between panic from the trouble so lately
avoided and a desire to hear from Philip nothing
approaching condolence.
</p>

<p>
She sought escape in the commonplace.
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't mind him," she said, with a nod
toward the stairs down which the glowering Bill had
departed.
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit," answered Beekman.  "I only wanted
to get rid of him in order to tell you hew sorry I
am for&mdash;for&mdash;oh, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk about that, Mr. Beekman&mdash;please."
</p>

<p>
"But I must talk about it."
</p>

<p>
"Not now; not yet.  Tell me how you are."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm as near right as I ever am, or ever will
be.  But, Violet&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You're looking rich."
</p>

<p>
His eyes followed hers to his gilt-buttoned
yachting jacket.
</p>

<p>
"You can never judge a man by his clothes," he
said.  "Necessity is the mother of pretension."
</p>

<p>
"Are you married yet?"
</p>

<p>
"Hardly.  There are only two things that a man
can't honestly promise: to love, and to cease to love.
I'm still too poor to afford those lies."
</p>

<p>
Mary only half understood his mood, but she
was wholly intent on keeping him free of dreaded
topics.
</p>

<p>
"Do you hear anything of the people we used to
know?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Philip, "Rose was let off, you know,
and is back at the old address and the old business."  He
looked at his watch and started.  "By Jove," he
continued; "I must have been pretty tight.  I had
no idea it was so late.  I've got to be getting back
to the yacht soon."
</p>

<p>
He stood up, his cap in one hand.  Mary followed
him to the stair door, and there he turned.
</p>

<p>
"Violet," he said, "I am going to tell you how
sorry I am.  I am going to tell you, whether you
like to hear it or not."
</p>

<p>
The flush had gone from his face and eyes, leaving
them simple and sincere.
</p>

<p>
Mary's voice faltered.  She understood some
things that she had never before understood.
</p>

<p>
"It didn't matter none," she replied.  "You
couldn't help it."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay I couldn't.  I don't know.  These
things are too much for me.  But I do know that
I am sorry&mdash;sorry from the bottom of my heart.
And if I can ever do anything&mdash;anything&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He put out his hand, and, as she took it, he raised
her hand to his lips.
</p>

<p>
At that instant there was a yell of rage from
behind him.  Mary, springing back, saw him half turn
and reel.  She saw a brown, tattooed hand close
about his throat, choking his cry of alarm.  She saw
Bill Stevens's distorted face and red eyes appear
above Beekman's shoulder.  She saw a knife flash
and bury itself deep in the young man's side.  And
then, with a tremendous smash, both men disappeared
down those murderous, black stairs.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Mary that she lost not a moment in
running down to them; yet, when she reached the hall,
the little drama was finished.  The sailor was lying
stunned in a corner, and Big Lou, with the rescued
lamp beside her, was kneeling above Philip's
body and running her quick claws through his
pockets.
</p>

<p>
"Damn your soul, get upstairs!" she cried to Mary.
</p>

<p>
But Mary hesitated.  Overhead she heard the
skurry of skirts and hurried feet.  Before her lay
the man that had once so harmed her.  His coat
had been torn open and a great red smear grew
larger and larger upon his white silk shirt.  His
mouth was twisted, but still.  His gray eyes stared
at the begrimed ceiling: Philip Beekman was
dead.
</p>

<p>
She leaped across the body, tore back the bolts,
flung open the door, and nearly fell into the
pitch-black street.
</p>

<p>
As she ran around the nearest corner, she heard
the cry of Mike, the deckhand, who must have been
waiting nearby, and then the sharp alarm-call of a
policeman's night-stick.

XXX
<br><br>
HER FATHER'S HOUSE
</h3>

<p>
Her way must have led her first to the river
and then well northward: she did not know.
She did not even know whether she ran
or walked.  All that she did know was that, at least
for hours to come, she must put as many miles as
she could between her own tossing thoughts and that
still face with the staring eyes which lay at the foot
of the steep, dark stairs in Summerton's.  The clocks,
had she looked at them, would have told her that
the night was gone, but the winter darkness still
enveloped the city when she found herself at last
standing before an illuminated ticket-window and
addressing a sleepy clerk at a ferry.
</p>

<p>
"I want a ticket," she said, and laid down one
of the bills that Philip Beekman had given her.
</p>

<p>
"Where to?" yawned the clerk.
</p>

<p>
How did it happen that the name which rose to
her lips was the name of her native town&mdash;a word
that she had not uttered since the morning of her
awakening in the house of Rose Légère?  Perhaps
it was because the dead man had, with almost his
last words, pleaded with her to go home; perhaps
it was because that name, of which she had for so
long tried never to think, was, in reality, the one
always nearest to her heart; perhaps it was only
because no other town was familiar to her.  In any
event, the name was spoken without consideration
of the consequences, and, before she had time to
pause or to repent, the clerk had handed her the
change, and with it the bit of pasteboard that would
bear her home.
</p>

<p>
"There's a boat in ten minutes," he said: "but
you'll have to wait an hour in Jersey City.  The
first train doesn't go till six-five."
</p>

<p>
Of what immediately followed she had, thereafter,
no clear recollection.  She remembered only buying
a cold sandwich and a half-pint of whiskey in a
deserted café; crossing a bitterly cold, sullen stretch
of water from a twinkling cañon to a shadowy shore;
walking, for warmth, weary though she was, up and
down, and up and down, along a damp, echoing
train-shed, and then, at last, passing a clanging iron
gate, climbing into a coach, and falling, nearly
stupefied, into an uncomfortable, red-plush covered seat.
She had but the faintest mental picture of changing
cars, and none at all of any subsequent incident, until,
in a black dawn, there flashed upon her, from
between the frost-figures on the window, a bit of
landscape that warned her she was approaching home.
</p>

<p>
The track came suddenly to the river-side.
Beneath a gray sky, which, though the morning was
well advanced, the sun seemed afraid to climb, there
raced the mile-and-a-half wide strip of gray water.
It crashed across a ruined dam; it swept above a
submerged "chute" through which, years before,
the big pine-rafts from the upper Alleghanies used
to be hurled on their way to the Chesapeake.  There
had been a thaw: only here and there could Mary
see the ominous crests of the rocks that threatened
the mid-channel; the islands, with trees bare of
foliage, were under water, and far away, from the
cloudy York County shore, the high hills rose above
the mist, dun and cheerless, forbidding and cold.
With a quick catch in her throat, she saw the
river-road that she had so often tramped on holidays, now
axle-deep in mud.  Over there were the leafless
woods where, when the boughs were green, the children
used to picnic, and here, nearer the town, where
patches of soiled snow hid under the stunted pines,
was the path where one time came, for pink laurel
branches, a girl that she had been.  The engine
whistled sharply and stopped.
</p>

<p>
Mary mechanically readjusted the hat that she
had not touched since she had put it on for the work
of the evening previous&mdash;the evening so long ago.
She stepped to the platform.
</p>

<p>
The station was just as it had always been.  It
looked smaller and dirtier, but she knew that it had
not changed; and a sharp pain shot through her
heart at the realization that, in this town, everything
had gone on its placid way while so much had been
happening to one of its children.  There were the
same grinning gamins waiting for the New York
newspapers; the same negro porters from the two
hotels; the same station-master "calling the train,"
just as he used to call it in the days when she had
watched the outgoing coaches with envious longings
for a sight of the strange lands toward which they
were bound.
</p>

<p>
Then, as her aching feet touched the cinder of
the thoroughfare, she realized her danger.  She had
no plan, no scheme of accounting for herself; some
unreasoned impulse, partly, doubtless, the primal
instinct that drives the wounded beast to its den, had
overcome her fears and turned her face in the
direction of the home whither she had, for so long,
dreaded to return.  But now she was seized with a
terror of recognition by the townspeople, and so she
lowered her head and walked, with the swiftness of
panic, among the little knot of loafers about the
station-door.
</p>

<p>
Now that she was here, what was she to say, what
to do, where to turn?  She moved, unable to evolve
any order from the chaos of her thoughts.  She could
only go over and over the memory of that last day
in school; the early violets, purple and fragrant,
peeping through the lush grass on the lawns of
Second Street; the flaming oriole in the Southwark yard;
the lazy sunlight flowing through the open windows
of Miss England's sleepy classroom.  Mary's blue
eyes were bright then, her mouth was red, her cheeks
pink; lithe, strong-limbed, and firm of body, her
walk had owned the easy, languid grace of a wild
animal.  And now, the lawns were bare; only a few
persistent sparrows hopped in the gutters and along
the ground; the sky was empty of sunlight, and
she&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
She came to a supreme pause.  Habit had led her
aimless feet.  She was standing, in the full morning,
before the two-story brick house that was her father's
home.
</p>

<p>
She knew that the door remained unlocked from
dawn to night; but she did not at once enter.  She
was afraid to go in, afraid to stand still, afraid to
go away.
</p>

<p>
Then, from the next house, came decision.  It was
Etta's, her married sister's place, and she heard
someone within it rattle at its door.  Anything was
better than a meeting with Etta: Mary quietly
opened the door to her father's house and slipped
inside.
</p>

<p>
She went down the brief, darkened hallway, past
the drawn curtains of the parlor, through the
twilight of the dining-room, and stopped at the open
entrance to the small, crowded kitchen, where, among
neatly arranged and brightly polished pots and
pans, her mother was bending over the glowing
stove.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Denbigh looked up with a start.  Still
stooped, still hatchet-faced, but grayer and more
shrunken, she stood there, her sleeves rolled from her
thin forearms, her forehead wet by present labor, her
mouth set hard by labors gone.
</p>

<p>
"Get out o' here!" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Mom!"
</p>

<p>
Mary raised and spread her arms in quick petitioning,
and then, in that stranger, Mrs. Denbigh recognized
her child.
</p>

<p>
"<i>You?</i>" she cried.
</p>

<p>
She dashed her damp hands to her checkered
apron; she stepped toward her daughter with her
own arms wide.  She bent to kiss her&mdash;and she drew
as suddenly away.
</p>

<p>
"There's liquor on your breath!" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Mary, her voice low and trembling.
"I&mdash;I ain't been well, mom."
</p>

<p>
The kiss was given, but less abandonedly than it
had promised, and, as the mother drew away, her
keen eyes searched the girl from face to feet.  Over
the multitude of maternal questions there rose the
three for which Mary was least prepared.
</p>

<p>
"Mary&mdash;what is it?  Where is he?  Didn't he
treat you right?"
</p>

<p>
They caught the girl at her weakest point.
</p>

<p>
"Who?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Who?"&mdash;Mrs. Denbigh's eyes grew stern again.&mdash;"Who?
You needn't say no more than that still!
I ought to have knowed when I seen you.  Nobody
could look at you yet and not know.  Why,
you're&mdash;you're <i>old</i>!  Your things are worn out.  You&mdash;&mdash;"
her tone increased to loud accusations.  "Where did
you get them clothes?"
</p>

<p>
Mary's lips faltered.
</p>

<p>
"I bought 'em," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Did anybody see you come in here?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.&mdash;No, nobody did."
</p>

<p>
"Thank God for that!"  Mrs. Denbigh pointed
a long, gnarled finger at her daughter.  She pointed
it at the bedraggled hat, still bearing traces of a
finery too pronounced for that small town.  She
pointed to the waist and to the skirt.  "It's true,
then!" she cried.  "It's true, then!  You've been a
bad woman!"
</p>

<p>
In the doorway Mary swayed.  She leaned heavily
against the wall.  She was too tired to lie.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," her mother echoed; "yes&mdash;an' you own
up to it!  The whole town said it; your pop said it;
they all told me yet&mdash;an' I stood up fer you; I
showed 'em your letter; I says you was married; I
kep' on believin' you'd write; I stuck to it&mdash;an' now
you come here to shame me.  You come here when
you're worn out&mdash;when no one else'll have you&mdash;you
come here, brazen, not carin' still, a bad woman&mdash;<i>a
bad woman</i>&mdash;an' I guess you think I'll take you
in!"
</p>

<p>
Her poor face writhed.  Her dim eyes shot fire.
Her withered breasts rose and fell in a spasm of
indignation and wounded pride.
</p>

<p>
Mary, still leaning against the kitchen wall, put
out her hands as if to ward away a blow.
</p>

<p>
"Don't, mom," she said.  "Please don't."
</p>

<p>
"I will!  I've a mind to beat you.  I'd like to
know what possessed you to flaunt yourself in this
place.  You can't stay here.  You can't stay in this
house that you've shamed still, an' you can't stay in
this town."
</p>

<p>
"Mom!"
</p>

<p>
"You can't stay in this town.  Do you hear that?
If you do, if you try to stay here and mock me, a
decent woman, I'll have you arrested; I'll have you
sent to the lock-up; I'll&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mom," interrupted Mary.  "I won't hurt you.
I didn't mean to hurt nobody.  I didn't come here
to do no harm."
</p>

<p>
"How kin you come here yet without doin' harm?
Ain't you done enough without comin' back here to
shame your own folks?"
</p>

<p>
"But, mom," Mary pleaded, "I won't shame nobody;
I'll do whatever you say."
</p>

<p>
Little Mrs. Denbigh collapsed upon a kitchen
chair.  She rocked from side to side.  She fanned
herself with her checkered apron; grief conquered
anger; and long dried tears came at last to her old
eyes and coursed, unrestrained, down her hard
cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"What did I ever do fer to deserve this?" she
moaned.  "What did I ever do to receive this
judgment?  A child o' mine!  A child o' mine!  An' her
the baby that she was!  Didn't her pop an' me bring
her up the best we could?  Ain't I always lived
accordin' to the Lord's word?  What have I done to
deserve this?"
</p>

<p>
Mary stepped to the weeping woman's side.  She
put her fingers to the gray hair and stroked it,
timidly.
</p>

<p>
"Go away!" cried the mother.  "Don't you
dare to touch me!  Don't you dare yet to pollute me!
Oh!  A child o' mine to do this!"
</p>

<p>
She fell into another paroxysm of grief, and Mary
sank to her knees and took one of the gnarled hands
between her own hands.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, mom," she said; "I'll tell you all about
it, an' then you'll know."
</p>

<p>
She did tell her, as much as she dared; but
Mrs. Denbigh only half understood.  The elder woman's
life had been cast in a mold; it had long since
hardened into a destined shape, and no sympathy on her
own part, no explanations on the part of another,
could alter her.  Dire necessity she had often known,
but she had not known it amid surroundings where
the sufferer's only course was that which alone had
been possible for Mary.  If she softened, it was not
because she comprehended, but because Mary was
her child.
</p>

<p>
"Don't tell me no more," she said at last.  "You
could 'a' gone to work."
</p>

<p>
"I tried that, an' nobody'd have me."
</p>

<p>
"You could 'a' gone to some church-folk."
</p>

<p>
"I did, but they couldn't get me a job."
</p>

<p>
"You could 'a' gone to some institution a'ready."
</p>

<p>
"How'd I have lived after I come out?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you shouldn't 'a' run away in the first
place.  Didn't we treat you right?"
</p>

<p>
To have answered that question in the negative
would not have been to be altogether true, and Mary
did not even yet see enough clearly to discern that
the conditions which had driven her from home were
economic forces that made parents and child equally
blameless.
</p>

<p>
"Can't I stay here?" she appealed.  "Can't I
please stay here an' work for you?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Denbigh shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"I'd work hard.  I'd help you.  I wouldn't never
complain.  All I want is just to be quiet.  I'd work
hard.  Nobody'd never know."
</p>

<p>
"It'd be all over town by evenin' still."
</p>

<p>
"No, it wouldn't.  I'd say I was a widow.  I'd
say&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Think o' your pop," sobbed Mrs. Denbigh.
"Why, he'd&mdash;he'd kill you, Mary!"  The mother
shivered as she considered the wrath of the giant,
whom hard work had hardened past the touch of
all the tenderer emotions.  "He'd just beat you up
an' throw you into the street for everybody to see!"  She
half rose in a new anxiety.  "Why, he's on the
early shift, an' he might come here 'most any minute.
Etta might come in, an' Sallie'll be back from school
soon."
</p>

<p>
"But, mom," Mary blindly persisted.  "I'd work
so hard!  I wouldn't never be cross.  I'd help you.
I'd do all the housework, an' you could teach me to
cook the way you do."
</p>

<p>
"We got to think o' Sallie yet," continued
Mrs. Denbigh.  "Every time she gets mad now she says
she'll run away like you done.  We got to think o'
her.  She's a growin' girl, an' what'd it be to have
you around her?"
</p>

<p>
"But, mom, I won't hurt her.  Can't I just stay
an' work, an' wash dishes, an' such things?  I
wouldn't mind washin' dishes"&mdash;Mary smiled
wanly&mdash;"like I once did."
</p>

<p>
"An' then there's Etta," said the mother, still
busied in her own confusion.  "She's got a baby&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A baby!"  Mary's heart leaped.
</p>

<p>
"Such a lovely baby girl&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Can't I&mdash;&mdash;?  Oh, mom, can't I just get a peep
at it?"
</p>

<p>
"How could you?&mdash;An' we have to think what
it'd be for her if you was here an' she growed
up."
</p>

<p>
The prodigal choked with tears.
</p>

<p>
"Mom, mom!" she pleaded.  "How'd I hurt
'em?  You don't think I'd&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"The town'd think so, an' the town'd tell 'em so,
too.  An' anyways, Mary, we're poor, we're dreadful
poor.  The mill was shut down all summer an'
fall.  It's only just started a'ready, an' it's only
workin' half-time now.  We ain't had money fer
months still, an' now it all goes fer old bills.  We
couldn't do it, even if we wanted to."
</p>

<p>
For half an hour more Mary begged, but she
begged in vain; and though the mother ended by
another attack of tears, and though the two wept
together in each other's arms, they knew that they
were together for the last time.
</p>

<p>
"Your clothes are so thin!" quavered Mrs. Denbigh,
with a pathetic endeavor to sink her grief in
practical anxiety.  "You ain't got no coat, an' your
feet are near on the ground still."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Denbigh had no money; there was literally
not a cent in the house; but she unearthed from an
old trunk, and pressed, for pawning, upon Mary,
a heavy, old-fashioned gold bracelet, which had been
a wedding-present; and, though the daughter
protested that she had money enough to buy some
clothes, the mother got her own coat upon the
daughter's shoulders.
</p>

<p>
They were still standing in the kitchen, as women
awaiting the summons of death, when first one
steam-whistle and then another began to call across
the town.  It was noon, and the moment of puddler
Denbigh's return.
</p>

<p>
Without a word they walked, hand in hand, across
the short back-yard, for Mary, it was tacitly agreed,
must not risk an appearance upon the street in the
neighborhood of her father's house.  Without a
word, Mrs. Denbigh's knotted fingers opened the
latch of the white-washed gate.  Without a word
mother and daughter flung themselves into each
other's arms again, and then, still in silence, Mary
trudged away.
</p>

<p>
She did not look back until she came to the first
corner, and, when she got there, she saw her mother's
shrunken body still at the gate, the old hand waving,
the aproned figure shaking with sobs.  It was still
there when Mary reached the second corner; but
when she turned at the third, it was gone.
</p>

<p>
Her pain was no longer poignant.  Grief had
reached the mark whence it passes to stupefaction;
and Mary pursued her way as if her actions were
those suggested to a subject of hypnotic control.  In
order to avoid the crowd at the station, she walked
on up the alley, until the alley ended in an
intersecting turnpike along which ran the trolley line to
the county-town.  She waited there, stolidly, for a
car, mounted that, descended at the end of the road,
and, after another delay, climbed upon a train that
would take her without change to Jersey City.  For
nearly twenty-four hours she had eaten nothing; but
she bought another small flask at the terminus, and,
as the ferry-boat glided between the creaking slips
into the tossing water, she took a deep draught of
whiskey.
</p>

<p>
She walked to the stern and looked over the side.
It was night.  Here gleamed the railway signs under
which the boat had just passed&mdash;the signs of those
roads that, she had now discovered, ended as fatally
for her freedom as if they had ended in an
insurmountable wall.  Ahead towered the other walls, the
black walls of that living prison&mdash;that vast,
malevolent, conscious jail&mdash;into which she had once gone
with such a store of hopes whereof not one had ever
been fulfilled, of anticipated pleasures whereof not
one had ever been tasted, and to which she must now,
to serve out a life-sentence, return.
</p>

<p>
Must she return?
</p>

<p>
She looked up and down the dismal river, crowded
with trafficking craft, and she remembered that other
river at home as she had seen it on the spring
afternoon when she had played the truant from school.
She remembered the swirling eddies across which
the nearer hills had been changing from brown to
green; she remembered the descending Donegal Valley,
fresh with germinating life, the flowering shrubs,
and the sap-wet trees along the shore, the scent of
a warm April, and the music of the Susquehanna.
These things she remembered, and then she looked
again at the nearing city.
</p>

<p>
Must she return?
</p>

<p>
She touched the rail.  Over that lay certain escape.
The deck was deserted; the movement would be
quick; the plunge&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
She leaned forward, she saw the leaping, greedy,
icy waves, and, with a loud sob, staggered back to
the bench that ran along the exterior of the upper
saloon.
</p>

<p>
She could not do it.  With nothing but suffering
and horrors to live for, she could not put an end to
life.  She was afraid of the cold; she was afraid
of the struggle; she was afraid of the pang; she was
afraid of Death.  It was a new thing&mdash;Death; she
had been afraid of it ever since that morning of her
awakening when the thought of seeking it had first
occurred to her.  Since her first crossing of this
water, her experiences had been a procession of new
things, each more terrible than the last; she had
come to dread the new, and this novelty of death
she dreaded lest it should be the most terrible of all.
Life, which had robbed her of everything else, had,
at this last, robbed her of the courage to quit it.
</p>

<p>
Youth, hope, purity, strength, beauty, the ability
to work, even lust and hate&mdash;all these were dead
within her, dead beyond possibility of resurrection.
If Max had only given her a child!  If he, or
anyone of the others, had only killed her!  But they
had murdered Love, and the only thing that lived
in her was the fear of death.
</p>

<p>
Out of the bitterness of her own heart, out of the
abysses of her own knowledge of things as they are,
she saw much of the truth.  A rare good fortune had
favored Katie Flanagan; but Mary, her parents, Rose
and her girls, Carrie, Policeman Riley and Magistrate
Dyker, even Angel and Max&mdash;not one of them, well
regarded, could be unequivocally condemned.  They
were all, preying or preyed upon, an inevitable result.
They were but the types of millions everywhere.
New York itself, with all its women-slaves and
men-slaves, must be but an illustration of what the other
cities of the world are and have been.  No rescue of
a slave could put an end to the slavery.  Something
was wrong; but what that something was, or how it
was ever to be made right, she could not guess.  She
knew only that, down the years, wherever walked the
great god Poverty, that great god led Prostitution by
the hand.
</p>

<p>
Finally comprehending, if unable to formulate,
these things, at ten o'clock that night Mary Denbigh,
remembering what Philip Beekman had told her,
rang the doorbell of a familiar house and faced what
she would once have feared more than death&mdash;she
faced complacent, untroubled, prosperous, and
protected Rose Légère.
</p>

<p>
The woman, still the good-natured woman of the
brewery-calendar, cut short Mary's flow of apologies.
</p>

<p>
"Ferget it," she said.  "It don't matter what
you did.  You didn't know any better.  Here: just
take this ten dollars and tell me what else I can do
for you."
</p>

<p>
And Mary pushed the money away.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want that," she said.  "I want&mdash;oh,
Miss Rose, won't you please take me back?"
</p>

<p>
But Rose, surveying the human ruin before her,
shook, very positively, her masses of yellow hair.
</p>

<p>
"No," she answered, "I'm sorry, but I can't do
that.  It wouldn't be good business.  You see, the
life's got you, Violet: you're all in."

<p class="quote">
We, the members of the Additional Grand Jury for the
January term, 1910, respectfully present as follows:
</p>

<p class="quote">
In the charge delivered to us by Your Honor on the 3rd
day of January, 1910, Your Honor said:
</p>

<p class="quote">
"There have been spread broadcast in the public prints
statements that the City of New York is a center or clearing
house for an organized traffic in women for immoral
purposes, or what has come to be known as the 'white slave'
traffic.  Some of these statements may have been published
with ulterior motive and may have been mere sensationalism,
but some are said to be based upon official investigation and
charges made by persons who profess to have knowledge of
the fact.

<p class="quote">
"This traffic in women, it is charged, follows two main
objects: First, the procuring of women of previous chaste
character, who through force, duress, or deceit are finally
made to live lives of prostitution; second, the procuring of
women who are already prostitutes and placing them with
their consent in houses where they may ply their trade.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * * *
</p>

<p class="quote">
"But the main object, gentlemen, which I desire you
to keep in mind throughout your investigation is the uncovering
not alone of isolated offenses, but of an organization,
if any such exists, for a traffic in the bodies of women.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"You should make your investigation sufficiently broad
to cover not only present conditions, but also conditions
existing in the past within the statute of limitations.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"I charge you that it is your duty to pursue this inquiry
into every channel open to you and to present to the court
the facts found by you."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Pursuant to Your Honor's instructions, we have made an
investigation into the matters referred to in Your Honor's
charge.  We have called before our body every person whom
we could find who we had reason to believe might have
information on the subject.  Among others were the
following: a member of the National Immigration Commission
assigned to investigate conditions relating to importing,
seducing, and dealing in women in the City of New York;
the author of an article which appeared in <i>McClure's
Magazine</i> for November, 1909, entitled "The Daughters of
the Poor"; a former under sheriff in the County of Essex,
New Jersey; the President of the New York Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children; the author of a pamphlet
entitled "The White Slave Traffic"; a member of the New
York State Immigration Commission appointed by Governor
Hughes in 1908; a former Police Commissioner of the City
of New York; detectives and other agents especially
employed in connection with this investigation; members and
ex-members of the New York Independent Benevolent Association;
witnesses in the specific cases presented to this Grand
Jury, as well as a number of other citizens.  In addition, the
foreman, the District Attorney and his Assistants, have
interviewed representatives of the following organizations:
</p>

<p>
The Committee of Fourteen; its Research Committee;
</p>

<p>
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
"The Additional Grand Jury, sworn in in January by
Judge O'Sullivan of the Court of General Sessions, was
charged with the investigation of the truth or falsity of
certain statements which had been publicly made during
the past few months to the effect that the City of New York
is a center or clearing house for an organized traffic in women
for immoral purposes, or what has come to be known as
the 'white-slave traffic.'
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Pursuant to this charge the Grand Jury has been seeking
legal evidence on this subject from all available sources.
The information which many citizens have volunteered to
give has proved in most cases to be general rather than
specific.

<p class="quote">
"Before closing its investigation the Grand Jury desires
to announce publicly that it will be glad to receive definite,
specific information as to the existence in this county of any
traffic in women for immoral purposes from any citizen
or official or other individual who has such information.
Those who are willing to assist the Grand Jury in its
investigation are asked to call at the office of James
B. Reynolds, Assistant District Attorney, Criminal Court
Building (within the next week).  It will save the time of many
individuals and of Mr. Reynolds if only those appear who
are willing and able to present facts regarding the specific
matter above stated.

As a part of this investigation evidence has been presented
to us and we have found 54 indictments:
</p>

<p class="quote">
22 for rape;
</p>

<p class="quote">
16 for abduction;
</p>

<p class="quote">

</p>

<p class="quote">
6 for the violation of Section 2460 of the Penal Law,
entitled "Compulsory Prostitution of Women."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
We have found no evidence of the existence in the County
of New York of any organization or organizations,
incorporated or otherwise, engaged as such in the traffic in
women for immoral purposes, nor have we found evidence
of an organized traffic in women for immoral purposes.
</p>

<p>
It appears, on the other hand, from indictments found by
us and from the testimony of witnesses that a trafficking
in the bodies of women does exist and is carried on by
individuals acting for their own individual benefit, and that
these persons are known to each other and are more or less
informally associated.
</p>

<p>
We have also found that associations and clubs, composed
mainly or wholly of those profiting from vice, have
existed, and that one such association still exists.  These
associations and clubs are analogous to commercial bodies
in other fields, which, while not directly engaged in commerce,
are composed of individuals all of whom as individuals
are so engaged.
</p>

<p>
The "incorporated syndicates" and "international
bands" referred to in published statements, we find to be
such informal relations as have just been spoken of, while the
"international headquarters," "clearing houses" and
"pretentious clubhouses" mentioned are cafés or other so-called
"hang-outs" where people interested in the various branches
of the business resort.  These and the houses of prostitution
are also referred to as "markets."
</p>

<p>
The "dealers" and "operators" are the so-called
"pimps" and "procurers," the "pimp" being referred to as
the "retailer" and the manager of houses as the "wholesaler."
</p>

<p>
The only association composed mainly or wholly of those
profiting from vice, of the present existence of which we
have evidence, is the New York Independent Benevolent
Association, organized in this city in 1894 and incorporated
in 1896.  This association has had an average membership
of about 100.  Its alleged purpose is to assist its members
in case of illness, to give aid in case of death, and to assure
proper burial rites.
</p>

<p>
After an exhaustive investigation into the activities of
the association and of its members we find no evidence that
the association as such does now or has ever trafficked
in women, but that such traffic is being or has been carried
on by various members as individuals.  We find that the
members of this association are scattered in many cities
throughout the United States.  From the testimony adduced
it appears probable that the social relations of the
members and the opportunity thereby afforded of communicating
with one another in various cities have facilitated
the conduct of their individual business.
</p>

<p>
On one occasion where a member was convicted of
maintaining a disorderly house and a fine of $l,000 was
imposed upon him in the City of Newark, New Jersey, the
association voted $500 for his aid.  On another occasion in
the City of Newark, New Jersey, where several of the members
of the association were arrested on the charge of keeping
and maintaining disorderly houses, and one member was in
prison, the then President went to Newark, declared to the
Under Sheriff that he was the President of the New York
Independent Benevolent Association, and entered into
negotiations with the authorities in Newark on behalf of the
members who had been arrested.  We have, however, no
evidence of any such instance in the County of New York.
</p>

<p>
It appears from the testimony of various members and
ex-members of the said association that its membership is
almost entirely composed of persons who are now or have
been engaged in the operation of disorderly houses or who
are living or have lived directly or indirectly upon the
proceeds of women's shame.  None of these witnesses, in
answer to specific questions, could name more than one or two
present or past members whose record did not show them to
have lived at some time upon the proceeds of prostitution
in one form or another.  They claim, however, that all
members who have been convicted of a crime are expelled
from the organization when the proof of that fact has been
submitted, the offense apparently being not the commission
of a crime, but conviction.  It would appear that this
procedure is for the purpose of protecting the individual if
possible, and, failing in that, of freeing the association from
criticism.
</p>

<p>
Finding no evidence of an organized traffic in women,
but of a traffic carried on by individuals, we have made a
special and careful investigation along this line.  Owing to
the publicity given to the inquiry at its inception, it has been
difficult to get legal evidence of the actual purchase and sale
of women for immoral purposes, and our investigators have
been informed in different quarters that a number of
formerly active dealers in women had either temporarily gone
out of business or had transferred their activities to other
cities.  However, five self-declared dealers in women had
agreed upon various occasions to supply women to our
agents, but because of their extreme caution and the fear
aroused by the continued sitting of this Grand Jury, these
promises were fulfilled in only two instances, in each of
which two girls were secured for our agents at a price, in
the one case of $60 each and in the other of $75 each.
Indictments have been found against these two persons; one
pleaded guilty and the other was convicted on trial.
</p>

<p>
All of these parties boasted to our investigators of their
extensive local and interstate operations in the recent past.
They specifically mentioned the cities to which they had
forwarded women and described their operations as having
at that time been free from danger of detection.
</p>

<p>
Our investigators also testified as to the methods and
means used by these people in replenishing the supply of
women and in entrapping innocent girls.
</p>

<p>
Quoting again from Your Honor's charge:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
"This traffic in women, it is charged, follows two main
objects: First, the procuring of women of previous chaste
character, who through force, duress, or deceit are finally
made to live lives of prostitution; second, the procuring of
women who are already prostitutes and placing them with
their consent in houses where they may ply their trade."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Under the first heading, namely, the procuring of women
of previous chaste character, we find the most active force
to be the so-called "pimp."  There are in the County of
New York a considerable and increasing number of these
creatures who live wholly or in part upon the earnings of
girls or women who practice prostitution.  With promises
of marriage, of fine clothing, of greater personal independence,
these men often induce girls to live with them and
after a brief period, with threats of exposure or of physical
violence, force them to go upon the streets as common
prostitutes and to turn over the proceeds of their shame to their
seducers, who live largely, if not wholly, upon the money
thus earned by their victims.  This system is illustrated in an
indictment and conviction where the defendant by such
promises induced a girl of fifteen to leave her home and
within two weeks put her on the streets as a common
prostitute.
</p>

<p>
We find also that these persons ill-treat and abuse the
women with whom they live and beat them at times in order
to force them to greater activity and longer hours of work
on the streets.  This is illustrated in the case of another
defendant who was indicted and convicted for brutally
slashing with a knife the face of "his girl" and leaving her
disfigured for life, merely because she was no longer willing
to prostitute herself for his benefit.
</p>

<p>
In this connection mention should be made of the moving
picture shows as furnishing to this class of persons an
opportunity for leading girls into a life of shame.  These
shows naturally attract large numbers of children, and
while the law provides that no child under the age of
sixteen shall be allowed to attend them unaccompanied by
parent or guardian, it is a fact, as shown by the number of
arrests and convictions that the law is frequently violated.
Evidence upon which indictments have been found and
convictions subsequently secured, has been given which shows
that, in spite of the activities of the authorities in watching
these places, many girls owe their ruin to frequenting them.
An instance of the above is the case of a defendant indicted
by this Grand Jury and convicted before Your Honor, where
three girls met as many young men at a Harlem moving
picture show.  At the end of the performance, the young
men were taken by an employee of the place through a
door in the rear into a connecting building&mdash;used as a fire
exit for the moving picture show&mdash;where they met the girls
and all passed the night together.
</p>

<p>
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
has furnished statistics showing that since the 13th day of
December, 1906, 33 cases of rape and seduction originated in
moving picture shows, in some instances the perpetrators
being the employees of the shows.
</p>

<p>
It is not the purpose of this reference to bring an
indictment against the moving picture show, which under proper
restrictions may be an important and valuable educational
and recreative factor, but rather to point out possible
dangers inherent in performances carried on in the darkness and
the importance of the observance of safeguards by parents
or guardians, and of the strict enforcement of the law for
the protection of children.
</p>

<p>
Under the second heading in that portion of Your Honor's
charge quoted above, which refers to the procuring of
women who are already prostitutes and placing them with
their consent in houses where they may ply their trade, the
Grand Jury has made a special study of the class of
disorderly houses commonly known as "Raines-Law Hotels,"
the chief business of many of which is to provide a place
where women of the streets may take their customers.  The
testimony given shows that girls who brought their patrons
to certain hotels of this class were allowed rebates on the
amount charged their patrons for rooms.  Upon the evidence
brought before us, indictments were found against
seven of the most notorious of these hotels.
</p>

<p>
The abuse which has grown up in the conversion of the
so-called massage and manicure parlor into a disorderly
house, frequently of the most perverted kind, has received
our careful study under this same heading.  A special
investigation has been made of some 125 massage and manicure
parlors, in this county.  Less than half of these
establishments were found to be equipped for legitimate
purposes, most of them being nothing but disorderly houses.
The operators in such places had no knowledge of massage
treatment, and in certain cases where certificates of
alleged massage institutes were on the walls of the premises
they frankly admitted that they had no training in massage
and did not even know the persons whose signatures
appeared on the certificates.
</p>

<p>
In view of the above, it would seem important that these
parlors should be licensed by the Health Department of the
city and that all operators in them should also have a
license from some approved health or medical authority,
and further, that proper supervision should be exercised to
insure their operation for the legitimate purposes for which
they are licensed.
</p>

<p>
The spreading of prostitution in its various forms from
the well-known disorderly house into apartment and tenement
houses presents a very grave danger to the home.  It
is inevitable that children who have daily evidence of the
apparent comfort, ease, and oftentimes luxury in which
women of this class live should not only become hardened to
the evil, but be easily drawn into the life.  The existing laws
for the suppression of this vice in apartment and tenement
houses should be most rigorously enforced and if necessary
additional legislation enacted.
</p>

<p>
But of the evils investigated under this head, the most
menacing is the so-called "pimp" who, as already stated,
while often active in seducing girls, is, to what seems to be an
increasing extent, living on the earnings of the professional
prostitute, constantly driven by him to greater activity and
more degrading practices.
</p>

<p>
We do not find that these persons are formally organized,
but it would appear that the majority of the women of
the street, as well as many of those who practice prostitution
in houses or flats, are controlled by them and usually pay
their entire earnings to them.  They prescribe the hours and
working places for these women, assist them in getting
customers, protect them from interference when possible, and
when the women are arrested do what they can to procure
their release.  While "their women" are at work, they
spend much of their time in saloons and other resorts where
they gather socially.  Although operating individually, their
common interest leads them to coöperate for mutual protection
or for the recovery of women who may desert them, and
for the maintenance of their authority over their particular
women.  It is an unwritten law among these men that the
authority of the individual over the woman or women
controlled by him is unquestioned by his associates to
whatever extreme it may be carried.
</p>

<p>
To obtain a conviction against one of this class is most
difficult, for through fear or personal liking, "his woman"
is loath to become a witness against him, and without her
evidence conviction is almost impossible.
</p>

<p>
Whatever one may think of the woman who adopts the
profession of a prostitute by choice, all must agree that the
man who in cold blood exploits a woman's body for his
own support and profit is vile and despicable beyond
expression.  Only through the arousing of an intelligent and
determined public sentiment which will back up the forces
of law in their effort to ferret out and bring to justice the
members of this debased class, is there hope of stamping
out those vilest of human beings found to-day in the leading
cities of this and other lands.
</p>

<p class="t3">
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
In view of the foregoing we recommend:
</p>

<p>
1. That no effort be spared in bringing to justice the
so-called "pimp."  When the character and prevalence of
these creatures are more fully realized and public sentiment
aroused regarding them, the inadequate punishment now
imposed should be increased and every legitimate means
devised and put into execution to exterminate them.
</p>

<p>
2. That the existing laws be more rigidly enforced to
safeguard the patrons of the moving picture shows, and that
parents and guardians exercise more careful supervision over
their children in connection with their attendance upon these
shows.
</p>

<p>
3. That vigorous efforts be made to minimize the
possibility of the Raines-Law Hotel becoming a disorderly
house, and that where necessary proper supervision and
inspection looking toward that end be provided.
</p>

<p>
4. That the so-called massage and manicure parlors be put
under the control of the Health Department; that a license
from this department be required for their operation; that
certificates be granted to operators only by some approved
medical authority, and that proper measures be taken to
enforce these laws.
</p>

<p>
5. That the laws relating to prostitution in apartment
and tenement houses be rigidly enforced, and that the present
laws be supplemented if necessary.
</p>

<p>
6. That a commission be appointed by the Mayor to
make a careful study of the laws relating to and the methods
of dealing with the social evil in the leading cities of this
country and of Europe, with a view to devising the most
effective means of minimizing the evil in this city.
